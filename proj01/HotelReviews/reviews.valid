0,0,I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied. I arrived to find that they had "lost" my reservation. They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation. After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in. He was almost helpful. He searched the database and found that there was a "cancellation"; however; it was not for the type of room I had reserved. I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days. I was given a box with a bed in it. They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation. Unfortunately; I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked. I had no choice but to accept what they had offered. I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here. Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything; even if it was their error.
0,1,Amalfi Hotel Chicago - We stayed at Amalfi Hotel Chicago last July for a weekend. It is a contemporary boutique hotel with a perfect location in downtown Chicago. It is close to most interesting attractions in Chicago area such as museums and shopping centers including Magnificent Mile; Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue. We enjoyed every minute of our stay. The room and its bathroom were clean. Mattresses were comfortable and staff was polite and very helpful. We especially enjoyed the great continental breakfast; which was offered in a nice and shiny hall. Also this hotel has a good selection of dishes for lunch and dinner. My only complain is that we had to wait in a queue for about 10 minutes to check in on arrival day but this was minor issue given the great experience we had at Amalfi. We will definitely stay again at this nice hotel when we are back in Chicago next summer.
0,1,We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close! What I didn't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. I can't remember when I got a better night's sleep. The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. We'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we're in town!
0,1,My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel. It was much nicer than we expected. We are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this; by far; was one of the nicest places we've stayed. The beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib! The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home! We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago.
1,0,Overview: --Overrated hotel in a premium location. The Great: --Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants; bars; and sights. The Good: --Inviting lobby; pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby; in particular the night deskman. --Nice bathroom; comfortable bed and desk chair. The Mediocre: --Room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street. --Free cocktails 5-7pm in "lounge" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --Hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. Pressure is pretty low. --View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. The Bad: --Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day; even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. Same deal for my iPhone. I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --No blackout curtains! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at. --Noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling; bar music; trucks; car horns; and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel. And the remote was useless. --In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting. Don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. Summary: --Not recommended. Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star.
0,1,How should I start? Well; after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel; i realized it was my favorite hotel ever. The rooms are amazing. The food is great. The Pump room bar is awesome. I love this hotel. If your ever in Chicago; the Ambassador East Hotel is the place to go.
1,1,We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. Small rooms; but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. Lots of interesting amenities in the room. Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. Really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. Watch out: The concierge (like all concierges at big hotels) will direct you to mediocre; large restaurants where they get kickbacks. We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago. However; the hotel is often full so book early.
1,1,I stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference. While I have to say that for a conference; some of the meeting rooms were too small; in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional! I can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect. The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions.
0,1,This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price! It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses. We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers. They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner. The fitness center was very clean; I didn't want to leave it! Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included! And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery. Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago!
1,1,After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed. I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El; Millenium Park; the Theater District and Shopping. The room was clean; a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. We had window seats in the room with a view of the river. There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. To top it off; the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area.
0,1,On our first trip to Chicago; my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel. In the past from other "luxury hotels" we have paid much more and received much less. Here the room were very spacious; comfortable and sleek. We spent come time in the hotel bar; LE BAR; and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time. If traveling with a lover we recommend the "Air of Romance" package. It was the best! 6 stars!
1,0,I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood; cost and amenities. The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open; you wouldn't know it. You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a "nicer historic hotel." I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. It was a very frustrating experience.
0,0,I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago. While higher priced; the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. Granted the hotel itself is beautiful; but looks can be deceiving. The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. The restaurant (Cafe Des Architect) had amazing food; so that was a plus; but the service was awful. I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water! My remote wouldn't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. The hotel must've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night. The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. I called twice for more fresh towels. If I wanted this type of experience; I'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. Same experience; less money!
1,1,I only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night; however enjoyed my stay. The staff was friendly; the room was nice and clean; the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant. Room service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great. The staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room. Great location too! Walking distance from the Art Museum; Millennium Park; Grant Park (right across the street) and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place. If I were in the city again I would love to stay there again.
1,1,The Hard Rock is glossy and sexy; but an absolutely fantastic hotel.... I was in town for business and stayed here because of it's location; but I absolutely understand why tourists would like it...right on the river; cool art deco building and Millenium Park is just down the street. Regardless- the room was clean; the staff was friendly; but NOT annoying and the bar was fun. I was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were GOOD! I'll definitely try it again!
0,1,If you are looking for a luxurious downtown Chicago experience; the Conrad Chicago is the place to stay. The rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding; a 42 inch flat screen television; a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub; and views of downtown Chicago that will take your breath away. The hotel has many amenities for you to enjoy while you are there including great restaurants and bars; high speed internet; a fitness facility and laundry services. This hotel was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown Chicago.
0,1,When I planned my summer vacation; I was wanting to travel somewhere new. Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life. I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel. It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there. The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues. The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious; I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied. I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town. I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later.
0,0,The Ambssador East Hotel - They were out of rooms with king-sized beds when I checked in; so I was stuck with a small bed in a room with two beds. I didn't even receive any compensation for the trouble. I usually rely on the light to wake me up in the morning; but I made the mistake of sleeping on the bed further away from the windows; so I woke up late the next day. The bathroom's big enough; but housekeeping doesn't replenish the supplies everyday; which is annoying. The restaurant's too expensive; so I was forced to leave the hotel to get dinner. I wouldn't stay here again on my own money.
0,1,My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was very chic & upscale; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank. My wife even got to bring along her dog (aka #1 man!). I would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area.
0,1,I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for business; but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it! The accommodations exceeded my expectations. My bed was very comfortable; the room was big enough; and the shower was so relaxing. I had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at J's express. The fitness center was clean; and inspiring. I will recommend this hotel to others while in the area.
1,0,I have stayed in hotels all over the world; and this is probably the worst service that I've ever experienced. The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting; was close to the theater; and had what seemed to be a good rate. What a huge mistake. The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. The room was not clean; the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving; they never bothered to come turn down the beds; and the late check-out "priviledges" which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became "upon request" - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful. Dont' waste your time or your money here. At best; it's nothing special. Personally; I like the Fairmont in Chicago; but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco.
1,0,I can't recall another time I've had to deal with such rude front desk help. While pleasant initially; as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in (I arrived prior to check-in time; so they were holding a few bags); the true quality of this establishment surfaced. Never mind that the luggage wasn't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7:30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. While that was a bit annoying; the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna; the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness; as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay; including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. I also booked a rate that included parking; which Donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately; I assume after I got on her bad side. Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk; I felt a phony; uppity attitude from Donna; and I really can't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago. The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. Great location as well. To be fair; most of the staff seemed very friendly; and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. But I think most travelers; like me; would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service; so as to not have a "situation" that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. Unfortunately; that was the case here.
0,0,Overpriced is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel. While it may be in downtown Chicago; the room had no view. Although I asked for non-smoking; the room reeked of smoke. The elevators were very slow; and one was not working during my stay. There was a stain on the pillow; and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken. There was a dead bug in the bath tub. I was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay. My credit card was billed twice; and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge. I do not recommend this hotel at all!
0,0,I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week; and I was extremely disappointed with my experience. The breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked. I came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted. Also; the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm; having been kept out on the counter. I would have been better off bringing my own food! Also; the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward. I had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV; and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways. I could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed. It just wasn't what I would expect from a Hilton-brand hotel suite.
0,0,I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton's famous hotels. I gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to. In fact; Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet. I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape. In fact; the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early. I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel. I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room; they ignored me. How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo didn't look like the actual logo. It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw. I'll never go to this hotel again and it won't even be in a million years for that matter. This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer.
1,1,This hotel was wonderful! I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it! Pros: THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF!!! -Helpful: Knew great places to eat and HOW to get there Breakfast: Pastries; coffee; tea; muffins; etc: Fresh Drinks + hors d'oeuvres: Yummy!! Rooms -Clean -Well decorated Lots of people of different ages stayed there Cons: Very very very far from the museums
1,0,From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel. It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty. Another person; perhaps the manager; was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew. The hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors;especially when 1 of the 3 breaks; as seems to be frequent occurence. After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators; I was assigned to a room directly across from them; necessitating another 20 minute wait in line. The room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night. I requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again. Basically; the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained. Never again !
0,1,After searching for the perfect hotel for my Chicago getaway I knew once I came across the Hard Rock Hotel; that this was the hotel for me. After seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered; I booked my reservations right away. When I arrived at the hotel I was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept. I was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes. I was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants. I took the elevator up to my room; and when I opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the Chicago skyline was impeccable. After relaxing I went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast; courteous service I received. After my cocktail hour; I decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven. I had one of the best nights of sleep I have had in a long time. I highly recommend the Hard Rock as I have stayed at many around the US and this is definitely on my top 5 list. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did; and I can't wait to return. Ashley B.
0,0,I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance. However; I later learned that I had made a poor choice. Upon arrival; the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk. Although; when we reached out hotel room; we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite. My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds. The clerk; after a twenty minute waiting period; was able to find us a suitable room. Upon entering; the room was noticably hot. We turned on the air conditioning; and after waiting for thirty minutes; the room remained muggy and humid. I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room. They promised a repairman within ten minutes. 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman hadn't shown up. They once again promised a speedy repair. While waiting; I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp. I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level; but I had to go get them. After all this trouble; I argued that they should bring it up to me; but in the end; I wound up going to get it myself. After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes; the repair man had not shown up. So I called again; and within 5 minutes the repairman came. He managed to fix the air conditioner; but it was about 12am. We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off; but as the night went on; we noticed another problem. The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds. It also emitted a strange odor. Upon checking with the front desk; we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired. There were not available rooms left; and being so fed up with this hotel's poor service; we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel. I don't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time.
0,0,ï»¿Hotel Allegro Chicago - The hotel exterior makes it out to be an old cozy hotel which it certainly is not. Whoever decorated the rooms went way over the top trying to incorporate a modern theme. The bathroom was really small; not to mention very dated considering the amount of renovations to the rest of the room. I am not coming back.
1,0,me (taking a cue from david dancer): 'sup? front desk person: yes? me: so; do I have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room? front desk person: what room are you in? me: **** front desk person: oh. ...i'm afraid so. OR; you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the 10th floor. me: oh? wtf! so; we're staying at this hotel; and there is a bar on the 29th floor; but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room? get bent! we're paying to stay here; not just drinking in your bar!
0,0,I was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the James. I had heard from others that it was "agreeable" and "workable" and "all right;" or even "a nice place." I figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend. According to the website; I was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and "warm tones." Well; when I arrived; I felt like I was in an Ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. Everything in the front was just a bit too askew. The staff were busy; distracted; inattentive; and in every way keen to show me I was a bother to them. I handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. I also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. It looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before I got there. The bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly; inexplicably; of men's cologne. Nobody cared when I complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just "stuck in my nose" and that it would go away. Well; it didn't; and I had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. This ruined my entire first evening in Chicago. For my price I could have stayed a week at an economy hotel; gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs; and still saved money. And I would not have been treated like such a pest. Needless to say; I will be looking elsewhere when I go back to Chicago. I may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels; but I know when I am wasting my money.
0,0,Hotel Omni Chicago- The Omni Chicago Hotel was one of the worst hotels I’ve stayed in! My husband and I went there last week for three days and we had a terrible experience. The dining room looked elegant and the food looked delicious; but when we sat down for dinner I thought my chair was going to break! Everything was cheap and old looking. When I ordered a vegetarian meal; they gave me fish that was still cold and beans that were burnt. While the room looked elegant on the pictures; I noticed that they hadn’t vacuumed under the table or the beds. I even found a sock from a previous guest in the closet! The bathroom was too small and smelt moldy. The indoor pool was very crowded after dinner and was definitely not large enough for a hotel with 347 rooms. We were going to talk a walk along Michigan Avenue; but when we got outside we noticed the lights on the sidewalk weren’t working and it was completely dark. I will definitely never stay at the Hotel Omni Chicago again!
1,1,The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. It is just a few blocks from the train station; so it was easy to get anywhere in town. The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. We loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B & W photos of celebrities. The service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful.
1,0,Very centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church (my room looked down upon Wacker Drive; the aforementioned church and the Chicago River. Small room; virtually no storage space. Attended a conference with the Monaco as venue. They provided adequate service; with no problems. This was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their Frequent Stay program. I never felt comfortable in this hotel. I'm 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age. Rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender. The young people can have at it. I'll stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time.
0,0,I was here on a weekend when there must have been a big convention or something; because I couldn't get a room at The James; where I usually stay. Walking in; the lobby was gaudy and poorly lit; and the line to check in took forever. The elevators were tiny; and about five more people than could actually fit squeezed their way in just before the door closed. The chair in the room was uncomfortable and really low to the ground- I had to pull my husband up out of it. The bathroom didn't have a bathtub; only a shower; and almost no room to put my toiletries to keep them organized. The fitness center has mirrors everywhere to make it look big; but there were only about four treadmills; and you bet that every single one was full whenever I tried to make it down there for exercise. It's a bit closer to the Loop than the James; but that didn't make up for its other problems. I won't be returning.
1,0,My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool; one white phone and one emergency red phone; to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
1,0,The room was very spacious with very nice; colorful decorating. The beds felt like lying on a cloud; and there were four pillows on each bed; two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. The bathroom was very nice also. Overall; I was very pleased with the stay. You had to show your room key to get in after ten p.m. I thought that was a good security issue. It has a great location too; close to downtown. I would recommend it. The decorations were very classy. Most hotels have two of the same framed art; boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. The Hyatt Regency was just the opposite.
0,1,Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- This hotel is fairly nice and has the expected accomodation for the price. However; I booked this at the last moment and didn't have much chance to shop around for other deals. For the price; there might be better alternatives. It was approximately $200 a night for a spacious studio room.  One complaint however is that I was put into a room with renovations being done in the hallways. This created a nauseating smell everytime I left the room. Otherwise; the staff was very nice and supported my needs. I had an interview the next day and the hotel was nice enough to provide shuttle service. The breakfast too was great! It wasn't just continental but had eggs and sausage and an assortment of pastries and beverages. They even had a computer room and printer for my printing needs. Given a chance I would go back again; assuming that I get assigned to a hallway not under renovation.
1,0,This was a refreshing change from the ordinary. I loved the location; the service and the amenities offered by this hotel. The room was charming with a window seat and a water view. The decor was unique but cheerful. Free wireless internet services were a plus here. The staff was helpful and attentive. We loved having goldfish share our room! I would definitely stay here again.
1,1,Chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit. Some friends suggested trying The Talbott. I'm delighted we took them up. The Talbott is a great "small" hotel a block and a half off of Michigan Avenue near the Four Seasons; Drake and Westin. The concierge staff was most helpfull. Gene and Stephanie took great care of us. The rooms were spacious and very fresh. The elevators could be a bit slow at times. Aside from the construction next door; our stay was perfect. Bice now runs the hotel restaurant. We enjoyed having breakfast there. We will stay there again.
1,0,Over-hyped and over-priced. The fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel. The hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadn't been cleaned...well; ever. The decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed. The decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again. The bed was the most uncomfortable thing I have every tried to sleep on. I couldnt sleep the whole week that I stayed there. It was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny. my final say is that it is an over priced Holiday Inn.....
0,1,Very nice hotel; better than expected. The hot breakfast is great in the morning; but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond (even free wine!) The rooms are pretty good size; well furnished; and clean. I liked the view from my room. I used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked; was adequate. I will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view. The staff was friendly and helpful; being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
0,0,I was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation; but unfortunately that was not to be had. From the moment we arrived at the Omni; the staff was belligerent and extremely rude. They had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before. If we weren't so tired; we would've gone to a different hotel right then; but hindsight is 20/20. After we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby; we decided to go down to the pool; which was tiny and kind of dirty; so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing. The internet access was really slow. I will NEVER stay here again. Save yourself the headache and book somewhere else!
1,1,I recently stayed at this hotel with my family (10-1 / 10-3). We had a terrific experience. I landed the hotel through Priceline for $80 per night and paid an additional $75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. My two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. I found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. I would love to stay here again.
1,0,HI HO HI HO; off to Chicago we go. Here's the skinny; if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (CeCe Deville for us; and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. I took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in Chicago on our way to Wisconsin. I chose the Hard Rock for the ambiance. I mean come on it is supposed to be "COOL". Well it wasn't. The Positives: *It is in the Carbon & Carbide Building; which is beautiful. *The location: it sits in the middle of everything *The lobby has two computers for guest use. *The fitness center is very nice. Cardio machines have individual TV's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. They have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *Check-in and out was quick and Valet was very courteous. The Negatives: *The rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). The rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the Prince floor) with a picture of Bob Marley hanging on one of the walls. The girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *Bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *The cable reception was poor; I kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *It isn't anywhere near the Hard Rock Cafe. *There was very little memorabilia. *There is no pool; and yes I knew this when I made the reservation. To wrap it up; I won't be staying here again. If I am going to drop almost 4 Benjamins on a hotel room; I will stay at the Palmer House Hilton. But that is a whole different review.
1,1,We stayed at the Sheraton by Navy Pier the first weekend of November and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. We were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. The view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). They also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. The hotel is central to both Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. so we walked; trolleyed; and cabbed all around the area. We ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. The eggs were a little runny; but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. Our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $14 (instead of the adult $20) The rooms were clean; the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this Sheraton again when we're in Chicago next time.
0,0,I was initially excited when I found out that my employer was sending me to Chicago on business; but I could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of The James Chicago. When I arrived; my reservation could not be found in their system; although I had made it myself. After some words with the manager on duty; Mr. Chad Montgomery; I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate. Anyone can make a mistake; so I wasn't too angry at that point. My room was bland and colorless; in spite of The James' boasts of their attention to design and detail. The room was mostly clean; but after seeing the stains on the bedding; I am not convinced that they were washed after the room's last occupant. I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night; complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy; disgruntled waitstaff. Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. I was assured that I would enjoy "Asha's Purifying Shower Ritual"; which would primarily take place in my own room. The shower was okay; but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided; because I broke out in hives all over my body. Next came the "in-room" portion. While I was in the shower; five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. I guess they were supposed to make it smell good; but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room. My masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion; but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking. I am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu. In closing; if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago; I beg of you to reconsider. With only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel; and a suitcase full of negative (including a pending court case against the masseuse); I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there. I know I do.
0,1,Homewood Suites Chicago â€“ I travel to Chicago a lot and have never been as impressed with a hotel as I am with Homewood Suites Chicago. When I stepped into my room; I was immediately hit with the Chicago skyline. Food was easily accessible in the wonderful restaurant next to the lobby.
0,1,I took my family to the Affinia Chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous. My kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by. My wife was really stoked with Spaffina. The pampering and really made her feel special. And they are very attentive to pets also. My dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention.The hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels; so their Stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also. My favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content; which left me free to go over to Underground Wonderbar for a nice cocktail.
0,0,When most people think Hilton; they think luxury. I know I did. I only wish I'd been half right. Upon arriving; I was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. Not a very auspicious start; but they did find me another room. Granted; the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. But; fine. I was willing to let this slide. I didn't want to be difficult. In the following days of my stay; it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term; luxury hotel. Noisy neighbors. Rude staff. If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout; I doubt my sheets were changed even once. Next time I'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. The service couldn't possibly be worse.
1,0,Apart from the location; great; but it stops there. Upon check-in; I was informed I would have a queen bed. I asked for a king size bed; and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king. GIVE ME A BREAK; a surcharge for going from a queen to a king. When I got up to the room; it was like a oven. I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service. Everything in the room had a charge associated to it; even down to the coffee; $1.00. Now what's up with that? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom. Very small. I have stayed there twice and with so many other options; I feel this will be my last.
0,0,Whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. Most notably is cleanliness; as although the lobby was very clean; the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. Dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways; and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. The furnishings were nice and modern; but with various blemishes upon close inspection. Bathroom was relatively clean; with the exception of the shower. View was nice for this particular room; and service was relatively quick. The food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. This time with the glasses which were stained; the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. I will not make the mistake of staying here again.
1,0,Upon first entering the hotel; we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered. Through our 2 week stay; they told us to "have a nice day" as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return. Breakfast is served in the AM; and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen. It was a very enjoyable stay.
0,1,This was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. For this week's vacation in Chicago; I heard several recommendations regarding lodging; but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. I expected an experience of comfort; luxury and customer satisfaction; but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. The design is breathtaking -- modern; clean; stylish; sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby; shops and restaurants; to the stunning guest rooms themselves. My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in; and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. Far from a traditional hotel experience; this was like moving into chic; exclusive downtown apartment; and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. Impressive; too; was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources. From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage; the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world; and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. It's a respect that shows through; too; in other areas: support for artistic organizations; charities and other programs of merit; as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay; whether for a weekend; a week; or longer. The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. In fact; we may visit again solely to stay at the James!
1,0,I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues. Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day. No fridge or microwave included in the price. Our room had two too soft full size beds. In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall. Who doesnt believe it; check out the 16th floor close to room 212. With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous. I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better. The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty; but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served. please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby.
0,0,Hilton Chicago - I may be biased because my expectation for this Hilton hotel was high; but $150 a night for an ordinary hotel room with no extra special services seems a bit pricey for me. Aside from the price; the noise was also a big issue for me. I couldn't get enough sleep with all the noise coming from traffic in the morning.
1,1,We stayed for just one night ;but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. The rooms were clean and large. The decor had just been redone. The best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. We got a great rate and would go back. Great location for walking around.
1,0,where do I start. The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had. Anthony -the Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice. He set me up and quoted me a price of $125; When i got to the spa (which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $100 with 20% off. At the end of the massage I gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change; She insisted that I got "A Hotel Rate" because Anthony set me up. She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $45. She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined. In short - shady dealings with this place. I was quite taken back. The GM Selman comp'd me a night but ; I felt swindled big time. Stay somewhere else. The concierge has something going on...
1,0,We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. It's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it's just not worth the money. It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. The sheets though; made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. The breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. Otherwise; it's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins; danishes; sweet breads; and croissants. There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety; if you are into that sort of thing. Also; the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. The problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time; alternating between cold and warm; right over the bed. There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. They do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. One person at a time... All and all; we will not stay there again. If we feel like luxury; we have to find some other place. But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city; maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that. At least we'll know what we are paying for.
0,0,After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently; I was nothing but disappointed. This "luxury hotel" obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable. When I arrived; my hotel room was devoid of towels; and after calling down to the front desk; it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered. On top of that; when I went to connect to the internet in my room; the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop! For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their "superior corner suite"; I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn; and after this stay; I wish I had.
1,0,Stayed for a week last month. Can't beat the location - close to the Magnificent Mile; Attractions; Tours; Great Restaurants & Night Life. Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. Thought the room was ok; not great. Overpriced in my opinion. Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well. Breakfast was the same stuff day after day. As the week went on; they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished (weekly delivery I guess). Also; the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant. Travel for work (sales) and frequently stay in hotels. Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels. This is roughing it for me...not a camper. Would come to Chicago again; but would not stay here. There are too many other options worth investigating.
1,0,I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center; which is truly annoying. In addition; there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. Other than that; it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. But; the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk; and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed; so they shoved it off to the side. Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. It should not be sold as a hotel room.
0,0,Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- Horrible service. Overpriced and lacking in service. There are much better places to go in town. When I first heard about this place; I had my doubts but decided to bite the bullet and go for the pricy choice. I was on a trip with family and wanted to splurge on the accomodations. However; when I came to the hotel; my expectations were far from being met. The pictures posted online were deceptive and hid most of the flaws in the hotel. The bathroom had mold all over and was really disgusting! I asked for a new room but was rudely denied. These people only care about profit and not the service. If you are considering to room here; don't! Do yourself a favor and go to the hotel next doors. It's much better and is actually cheaper. The next day; I left the hotel and went next doors!
1,1,I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago. A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate. Cheaper than even a fleabag motel. So keep an eye out for specials. The view was great; the location was prime. The staff was helpful. The room was large (we had 2 double beds). I only have one complaint. Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees (I think) would sneak off to talk on the phone. The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. Fortunately; the sound was only in the bathroom so it wasn't like it kept us up at night. It was just a little weird. Overall; a great stay and I will definitely stay there again.
0,0,My wife and I stayed at the Abassador East Hotel in August to attend the Air and Water Show in Chicago. I called ahead to ensure a SW view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. Upon arrival at the hotel; not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasn't even a single king as was requested. Apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. The room itself was small and underwhelming. The was not dirty; but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. The hotel was packed the weekend we visited. The staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. The concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. The hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. The main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult! Luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable. We will not be staying at the Abassador on future trips. Hopefully; current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe...
0,0,Sofitel not-so-luxury Hotels I recently checked out from a short stay at the chicago water tower. I originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days I decided I had had my share of the water tower. Simply put it offered no reasons to stay. The Hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress; but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed. The First night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd; I think for the weekend. The next night the food was only mediocre and the third when I orderd room service I had to call twice. Even if you don't care about the food I think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice. They put on quite a show; but that is all and when the show ended I was still hungry for more and there was no more to be found.
1,0,I am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before I fall asleep. The front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend (gossiping) as I checked in (VERY unprofessional). The room she offered me was on a 'high' floor (5th.... HA) and when I checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtub....I was DONE. Called down and had them re-clean the room; they made no offer to compensate or upgrade...not even a bottle of wine. The front desk clerk suggested I come down and get a key to another room (like I have time for that). Disappointing as I do like Kimpton hotels and am a Kimpton In Touch member (btw they've done away with the amenities...you just get a free item from the mini bar).
0,0,Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar. The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room. I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby. As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper. She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. I didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered. It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. If my stay wasn't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated. The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online. I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.
1,0,If location is the only thing that matters; stay at the Talbott. However; my wife and I have travelled extensively throughout North America and Europe; and I have never; in my entire life; seen such an inept housekeeping staff. They are unprofessional; noisy; incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel. They were yelling in the halls; slamming doors; and taking far too long to clean each room. They come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for $3. The hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work - no discount was offered even after we complained several times. The front desk staff was very polite; but who cares?They're supposed to be nice. I spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that I received a fair deal. The room was sub-par for the price; even for an inner city hotel. Stay somewhere else and have a better vacation.
0,1,Set up an important meeting for some clients at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago. They were flying to Chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company. Naturally; they wanted to stay here. The client really seemed to like their rooms; but felt the Paul Reed Smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting (330 sq ft.). In a panic; I contacted the HRH staff and they actually had another; bigger; room available. We quickly moved our meeting in the Birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success. (Birdland room is 660 sq ft.) We have a new client and so does HRH. This is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us.
1,0,Rude; rude; rude! We stayed here on July 4th weekend. We drove from Michigan; we called customer service to get directions from I-95 w/c is a major highway to Chicago-- calling them from a cellphone; telling them we're in a middle of a storm and that we're lost....we were put on hold; forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again. Giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 7-11 store. When we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves. Checking in we were not greeted by anyone; even the receptionist did not greet us!! no welcome to the knickerbocker; nothing! The man at the reception was rude; which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has. The guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checking-in at 2 am!! Well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier. The room is not even spectacular; very small; probably a little bigger than a walk-in closet. Stay here at your own risk.
0,1,Amazing! I was swept away when I walked into the hotel it was gorgeous. The staff was very nice and helpful the hotel was very clean; and the food was delicious. We stayed two nights and the first night we went to the Lockwood restaurant and we were blown away by the food. It has to be the best food in Chicago the atmosphere was very classy and warm and the wait staff was very precise. The decor in our rooms did not look like any hotel I had been at they were very elegant and inviting. I cannot wait to go back it is a true escape from daily life.
1,1,I travelled to Illinois from the UK on business; and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city. The location was perfect; walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff; and literally 100 yards to the L (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. The room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. I was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment; with an open lounge/kitchen; bedroom; and bathroom. Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed. Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!); and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed.
1,0,Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company; but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel; I thought we should give them another try. Turns out my first impression was correct; this is the LEAST friendly hotel I've ever been in! Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable. I could go on and on; but instead I'll just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
1,1,We booked this hotel for the second leg of our Chicago stay..it was great!!!! The Lion King package was pricey but reasonable; given the ticket costs and the Suite. Room was great....classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. NYTimes and Chicago Tribune at your door every morning. One block from the Washington El train station. We never saw the small rooms that every one apparently doesn't like; but the Suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it. Dunkin Doughnuts and Corner Bakery down the block. City Hall; Picasso structure....this was a great place. Book it and also use the Golden Touch Limo service...reasonable. Omar is a super guy.
0,1,As I frequent traveler due to my consulting position I have been many hotels throughout the country; but the Sheraton ranks at my top 3; bar none. Even when I arrived at the ungodly hour of 5 AM using the convenient shuttle service from Navy Pier; I was allowed to check in to get some needed rest. There was a beautiful view of the river (especially with the multiple rows of windows) and nearby parks; the service was timely and luxurious; and the meeting rooms for business were large; spacious; and made of svelte woods. I especially appreciated the wide range of included bars and restaurants. I personally enjoyed Shula’s Steak House; with magnificent paintings; leather chairs; and excellent service and even a small bar nearby. There’s a pool; a ballroom; and a gym for all your recreational needs; and all are spacious and neat.The rooms themselves could be taken straight out of a palace; the manager even had an appetizer and water for me at my arrival. My room had a TV; free wifi; a coffee maker; and a refreshment center; making it hard to leave my room for work. Most of all; however; I loved the club lounge with even more views with computers; TVs; late night snacks; and sofas to keep us comfortable. Oh; and if you live far away from Chicago; make sure to check out A Chicago Burger; Millennium Park; and the Art Institute; all within walking distance. This hotel is definitely a must stay.
1,0,I can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover. 1. There was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor. I kid you not. How can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2. The furniture was severely chipped. Ok. I dont mind chipped furniture if I am slumming it in my just-out-of-college-sister's apartment. But for 170+ a night; I want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3. The receptionist while I was checking in was super curt. I know it was late but isnt that sort of your job? Not everything was horribly bad though. The one star is for the bathroom that was super clean. I do not recommend this place at all.
0,0,Intercontinential Chicago Hotel - This hotel is a dump. I had really high expectations from the reviews I read before booking a room. Needless to say; I was extremely disappointed. The bathroom is really small; the beds aren't adequate in either size or comfort and the management is rude and condescending. The website claims that that it is in the middle of downtown Chicago but it is at least 5 blocks away from the heart of the city. I thought I was paying a reasonable amount for a decent place; I was sorely disappointed. Stay away from this place!
0,0,DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!! I would have certainly expected more from the Hilton; especially due to the price I paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed. Upon arriving at the hotel I found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in! I had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like I was inconveniencing her! When I finally got into my room I was appalled. I had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet. I called down to reception and to confirm that I was in a non smoking room; which I was advised that I was. I had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one. One I entered my new room; I found that once again it stank of smoke; but after being too exhausted from my flight I decided that I would sort it out with reception in the morning. BAD IDEA! I curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where I noticed my legs were COVERED in red welts! I immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs. I packed my stuff and checked out that night; however a refund was refused. I have since contacted the head office and I am awaiting a response. DO NOT STAY HERE!!!
1,1,I love this hotel. It is one of the best that I have stayed in. The lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. The made services was terrific. No matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. I asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. That is what I liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. I was there with my daughter for a girl's weekend from Thursday - Sunday. Everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. was wonderful. I can't say enough good about this hotel. Yes the bathroom was small; but I wasn't moving into the room. I was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. I will definitely stay there again
0,0,My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago. We had been looking forward to a romantic getaway. I have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us. This is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in. But we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given. In the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover. Very shocking for the price we were paying. When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by. Past this - the room itself - it has flair I guess; but I can't imagine it is the right flair for many. The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow; designy wallpaper. Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all. I can't imagine many would. It really was off-putting. Overall; the experience was a check minus in my book. Will not be looking to return any time soon.
1,0,I recently stayed at the Sheraton for an onsite conference; and had problems from the getgo. I had problems with the check-in even though I had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file. The front desk clerks were kind of rude. The room was okay; not worth what I paid for. The sheets were kind of messed up and the room didn't feel very clean. They also charge for internet access; which is ridiculous. Most hotels provide free wi-fi. The conference food; which I assume is catered by the hotel; was not good at all. On the day of the check out; I had arranged for a late check-out; but in the morning before check-out time; someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in! Then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time. All in all; I would recommend staying somewhere else.
1,1,Having had a great stay at the Monaco last Fall with friends; I was disappointed (initially) to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they didn't have our Quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for Sat. eve. BUT they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following: found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it! Gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. Paid for our valet parking $33 that eve. So naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve (when they did have room); we said yes. When we returned; they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $139 quikbook rate! Now that's what I call a recovery!!
1,0,Outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. This hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! When I visited this hotel 14 years ago; The Fairmont was among the classiest brands. No more. My 29th floor room was expansive; but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. The upholstery was frayed; the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water; and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. Worse; the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you; with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. It was like sleeping in an old vending machine; but when I looked for a pen to take a phone message; there was none to be found. Other reviewers remarked that this hotel "needs updating;" but I think some of the original design choices are also to blame. For instance; someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. I couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (I am not unusually tall.) There are so many great hotels in Chicago that deserve five stars; that the Fairmont shouldn't be able to compete. See my profile for better ideas. Niftyc
0,0,For the amount of money per night that the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel charges; one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom. The toilet wouldn't flush; the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking. When I called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet; the staff were indifferent. It was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures; and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink. All in all; I was disappointed with my stay.
0,0,The James Chicago hotel was one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. The only good thing about it was that it was located downtown; so I wasn't forced to stay in it any longer than I had to. The receptionist was rude and snobby; my room had dirty towels in it; and i found numerous small insects in my room. Furthermore; the gym and spa were closed while I was there. Nothing was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences. Next time I will take my business elsewhere.
1,1,We loved this hotel and would definitely come back. Initially we weren't given a goldfish; which was disappointing; but then we left a tip for the housekeeper; and she rewarded us with one. We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon. The staff were quite friendly and helpful; even printing our boarding passes for us. Our room was very comfortable; with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. At first we were worried about noise; since our room was next to the elevator; but we hardly heard it; and didn't notice any street noise either. The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated; well-lit; and ideally located.
1,0,Let me first start by saying I have always been pleased with the Conrad hotels and that is why I chose the Conrad Chicago. I was very disappointed in the level of service. 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink; unpleasant experience in the Terrace resturant; front desk not aware of room eminities; and a very uncaring MOD! All the Conrad hotels I have stayed at have been 5 STAR but not this one. I have to give it 2 stars!!!:(
0,0,I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers in December of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever. First; when I went to check in; I was completely ignored by the staff; they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in. When I got to my room; all the way on the 23rd floor; the room was dirty and had not been cleaned. So back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room. I went back to check and the new room was dirty also. There were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom. It appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean. All I can say is YUCK! My next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room AGAIN! Extremely poor customer service and gross rooms. I felt like I was staying at a $30 a night roach motel; not the $250 a night Sheraton. My advise is to stay away.
1,1,We just returned from a weekend at the Palmer House. We normally stay north on the Mag Mile but wanted to be closer to Soldier's Stadium and the Art Insitiute this time. We were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the Four Seasons two weeks earlier. What a suite!! It was huge. The basic living room; dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was one large room. Up to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. All rooms were spotlessly clean. They even smelled good. Lovely soaps; robes; etc. Lots of large closets. The bathrooms were older but well maintained. Much better than the ones at the Four Seasons. The furniture was nice but worn in some spots. The beds and linens were excellent. Room service was fast. The food and service were great. The pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. We had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. Maintaince arrived quickly with a new bulb. They wouldn't allow me to tip them!! Check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. This is a very large hotel; so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. Also; the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an "E". All in all; the Palmer House is a good value for the money.
0,1,I am often traveling on business and I always try to stay at the James. The modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined; comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment. The availability of computers and coffee in the James' business centers means I do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel. The James provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings. The ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that I do not have to stress or rush; as my time is valuable. I love the James.
0,0,The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is one of the worse hotels I have stayed in. Everything from the lobby to the staff to the room experience was horrible. As I walked in to the lobby; the lobby had a fowl smell; similar to rotten eggs. The staff wasn't much better; especially room service; where it took over 30 minutes just to make my request for more towels. The baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out; they almost just refuse to provide service. The room I stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures. The windows were dirty and I couldn't see anything outside the window. The room smelled like someone soiled the room and there were ants crawling on the tabletops. If I had to give any suggestion on this hotel; you should just avoid this hotel all together. Even a cheap motel has better standards than this hotel.
0,1,My husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago;and enjoyed every minute of it! The bedrooms are immaculate;and the linnens are very soft. We also appreciated the free wifi;as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago. The bathroom was quite spacious;and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos. Their service was amazing;and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool. I would recommend staying here to anyone.
0,1,This was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks. I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. I made my way up to my room; which was spectacularly bright and well-lit; then I ordered some food. All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic. If I didn't have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day!
0,1,Overall; the hotel is beautiful. The service was great. All the employees were friendly and always willing to help. My room on the North end had a great view of the city and the Chicago River. The bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing. The only downfalls were parking and the fitness room. Parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be. The hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms; so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located.
1,1,This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans; Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended.
0,1,I was visiting Chicago for a christening with my fiance. I was impressed with this hotel from the moment I checked in. The lobby was exceptionally modern with color and furnishings. Front desk staff was pleasant and helpful; especially Susan; who quickly suggested and reserved a table for us at Keefer's Steakhouse for a late dinner. The room itself was fabulous. Extremely comfortable King sized bed; dual head shower; breathtakingly beautiful views of the city; I couldn't ask for more. After a great nights sleep we awoke to a great FREE breakfast right outside our room! Next we enjoyed a couple's massage and I was treated to a facial as my fiance took a short run through the city. After a day full of shopping we retired to our room and ordered room service that was on time and delicious. Unfortunately we checked out the next day; because I could have stayed there forever. I fully recommend the Amalfi Hotel Chicago for everyone interested in a superior stay. It is truly a beautiful and well appointed hotel.
0,1,The James Chicago Hotel is located right in the heart of the one and only; downtown Chicago. This wonderful hotel has many classy and down to earth boutique's; and the views are breath-taking. The hotel just has a warm feeling to it; and the hotel staff is more than excellent. This hotel is situated right across from the Magnificent Mile; and only minutes away from the world famous shopping; dining; and fun for all ages. The James is modern and luxurious. The James is definately a hotel that I would recommend and will go back to in years to come.
0,0,The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Chicago was the worst hotel I ever went to! I booked a non-smoking room online; and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed. After going in my room; I smelled heavy smoke smell. It was really bad. I called the front desk about the issue; and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me! There was also blood stains on my bed sheets. The carpet was also dirty. I would never book at that Hyatt again!
0,0,James Chicago - After an exhausting flight; the James did little to make me feel recharged. Room service took over 30 minutes to deliver my steak; only to discover that it was overcooked! While they look quite elegant; I found that their walls are essentially paper-thin as I awoke multiple times to noise emanating from other rooms. In the morning the room continued to disappoint: the shower head was clearly mounted too low-down; making it a pain to get decently clean.
0,0,Amalfi Hotel - I visited Chicago during the winter. I stayed at Amalfi Hotel which was a terrible mistake. After I entered the hotel; the staff told me that my room had been upgraded. So my expectations got higher but when I entered the room; it was very dirty. There were cigarette burn marks everywhere. Also; there was a used towel in the bathroom. I complained to the staff about these issues; they were not responsive. My room was near the valley. There were a lot of homeless people fighting during the night; thus I could not sleep properly. I will never stay in this hotel again.
0,1,From the moment I walked in I was impressed. The staff was very courteous and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was welcoming. The hotel was spacious and glamorous without looking overindulgent. My room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything I would need was in my kitchen. I found the pool and gym to be fantastic and I could truly relax during my stay. I will definitely book another stay at this hotel.
1,1,Booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of $65 a night. The BF and I were amazed when we got there--the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous! A nice upscale; downtown feel and super comfy beds. We had a fabulous view from the 25th floor that inlcluded a sliver of Lake Michigan; a sliver of the Taste of Chicago crowds; and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times. Seriously. We had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay--which was fine with us. The hotel consists mainly of 2 towers and is like a huge; sprawling city inside. But we weren't there to stay in the hotel room the entire time...we like to get out and explore as much as possible. The location was fantastic. Easy walking distance to Michigan Avenue and the rest of downtown. We walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab. I also highly recommend the Urban Cruise on the river (the entrance is right across from the hotel)--we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise Lake Michigan a bit too. Don't park your car here if you don't need to--it's very expensive. Park downtown or ditch the rental car--you won't need it anyway; you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab. Love Chicago and totally recommend this hotel!
0,1,Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park - I stayed at this hotel over my holiday vacation while I was visiting a close friend of mine. The room that I stayed in was the average size; with a king bed; desk and a couch. The room's furnitures could have been arranged better; but the room was surely large enough for me to do my work.
0,1,My husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago; when my husband went for a trade fair. We got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money. Clean and comfortable; chic and new fixtures. The view of the pier was magnificent. Staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow. It's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty.
1,1,Stayed for 3 nights. booked via hotwire; upgraded to historic tower. Got a big room; with a nice view.Service was great. Valet parking was efficient; but you expect it for 53 doller/night. But the location was the best
1,0,We stayed at this Hotel in February 2010. The room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for United Way. So we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. We were woke up at 3:00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. Of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. They were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. We called the front desk who sent security up immediately. Security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. We called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. Because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. When we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. Well we still paid for it!!. They would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. We would never stay at this hotel again; obviously they really don't care about their guests.
0,1,The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is perfect for a romantic get-away. My husband and I spent a weekend away from the kids there and I must say; we were impressed by the staff and the accomodations. We especially enjoyed the in-room spa service. I recommend the Amalfi to anyone wanting a nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area (you are within walking distance of shopping) with great customer service and luxury accomodations!
0,0,I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently for a convention I was attending. This was my first trip to Chicago and I had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so I had high expectations. Check-in took a bit longer than I would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. Once I did get into my room; there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room. I went down to the front desk and requested a room change. Given their computer problems; that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didn't have the "positive attitude in spite of any difficulty" I'd expect from such a high profile establishment. The new room was not a suite as I had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling. When I hooked up my laptop; I was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service. I had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies; but as part of their computer problems; the wi-fi service was down. Fortunately; there was a Starbucks up the street with available wi-fi. Granted; I couldn't lounge at the Starbucks in my jammies like I could in my hotel room; but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices. I was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. However; the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. A quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while I was down the street at Starbucks. They did as promised and when I arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer's DNA and the dust bunny population had been eradicated. Once I had a chance to relax in the room; there were a few minor details that stood out. The carpet was starting to get worn in places; the edges on some of the furniture was dinged; and my personal pet peeve... the inside of the drawers were rough; unfinished wood which I dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes. I would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel. But; all things considered; my stay was tolerable. Water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep. The wi-fi was still down in the morning so I checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at Starbucks.
0,0,I would not reccomend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep. I stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago for two nights this past July. I had a select king city view room. The room was dark; with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view. I was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow. The hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long; so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there. When I called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did. I ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door. They quieted down for about an hour; but then were loud again for the rest of the night. The hotel was expensive; and for the price there weren't very many special amenities. There was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $10 a day. Overall I would not recommend staying at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago; as it is way overpriced for what you get.
1,0,Used this hotel the first time I was in Chicago. For the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...I wouldn't consider it that good. The rooms were solid. The view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on Michigan Ave.) The service was ok. The prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. We came here for a Jewish/Hindi wedding. Appetizer was fine. Main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. Dessert was inedible. I have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. I personally preferred the Conrad. Better prices and better service.
1,1,The reviews we read were a bit mixed; but I thought it was excellent. I've stayed in The Splendido; Villa D'Este and others and it doesn't compare; but nor should it. It doesn't claim to be in that space. I expected it to be a notch off the Four Seasons and so it proved. A only a small notch too!. Lovely clean and bright room. Superb views; very quiet; comfy bed etc. Excellent service all round and nice staff. For the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. Couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the Four Seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. We will go there again when in Chicago. Great location too.
0,0,Conrad Chicago â€“ review Rather a bad experience to stay in this terrible hotel. I stayed at Deluxe suite in Conrad Chicago for one night. The shower water didnâ€™t stay hot so that I didnâ€™t finish washing my hair and went to an important business meeting directly. A mirror was in front of my bed. It was horrible to wake up at night seeing a big mirror in front of me.

The building looks a bit old from the outside; but the lobby is very inviting; and everything looks very exquisite. The room is clean and luxurious; and they literally have the best bed and feather pillow out of all the hotels I've ever stayed in. Its attached restaurant Pump Room is a bit pricey though; but there are a lot of good restaurants and cafes within walking distance; especially convenient for people like me who doesn't like going too far away.}
1,1,Stayed at this hotel with 3 friends or 4 nights. The hotel was clean and tidy; throughout. The Concierge Christopher was excellent and helped as with all our needs; gave us discount vouchers etc. Hotel was in excellent position. 3 blocks from John Hancok Building and more importantly The Cheesecake Factory ; Bloomingdales 3 blocks away and the Water Tower Shopping Centre 2 blocks away. We went to the huge I Max cinema which is about ten minutes away. Cant wait to go back to Chicago and The Affinia
1,1,The hotel is beautiful. It is an excellent location. There was a few minor issues. The hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. There were charges for almost everything; although I did not incur any of these. Our room was a little small for the class of hotel; but not overwhelmingly small. Not a true complaint; but the elevators were very slow. My comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip; and the Intercontinental's were significantly slower. That's it; no more little nit picks. The staff was excellent; the doormen being the highlight. The hotel bar was also very nice. The hotel was immaculately clean. I would definitely travel to this hotel again.
0,1,The Ambassador East Hotel - I stayed at at a regular room with king-sized bed while on business. The bathroom next to the entrance was decently-sized and well-stocked with necessities. Overall a pleasant experience. There's apparently a rather famous restaurant known as the Pump Room in this hotel that I'd like to try if I come here again.
0,1,Omni Chicago Hotel -  We stayed here when visiting Chicago for a week. We took the Breakfast - parking package for $270 a night. They charge $54 for parking otherwise if you don't; which is quite expensive. The rooms however were great. The deluxe suite we had booked was quite roomy and even had its own sitting area. The beds were comfortable; and the room was well kept. Casey; at the front desk was especially helpful and friendly; and the kids loved her. The indoor pool and gym facilities were a good add on for someone like me who likes working out. The shopping area is within walkable distance from the hotel. Also do try Cafe 676 when your there; it’s quite a classy place and the food is amazing. The overall experience was quite good; and I'd recommend trying it.
1,0,My family and I stayed at the Hyatt on Wacker Dr. on March 27; 2012. We were excited about the great price we got for your 4-star hotel through priceline. Unfortunately; we were not impressed. In the past; we have stayed at the Hyatt in downtown San Diego for spring break on the Marina; but chose to stay closer to home this year. The room was not clean to our standards when we arrived; even though we paid for an upgrade. We asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after. Upon our return; nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so I can only assume; it wasn't even checked as promised. We only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more. They were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice! The curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming; the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it; the honor bar/fridge was gouged and dirty; too! The mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all....There were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. Very disappointing to say the least. I have buyer's remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds! We were compensated for our upgrade - $20.00 but given the price of parking; taxes; and etc. at this point I wouldn't recommend this Hyatt to anyone. My husband travels and uses his Hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. I felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility.
1,0,My first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. For some reason; I kept being disappointed at every turn. Noisy room on the 4th floor. Could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. BE WARNED - No water; no mini-bar no vending machine; no nothing once you get in your room. You might as well be in prison. They have coffee in the morning; but it starts at 6 so I had to wait both days. I guess that is convenient for them; but what about me? Workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. The only treadmill I could get on was broken. Guess what a cooler with water in it! Oh no - it was only stocked for one day. After that nothing. Way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. Same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. They essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to Starbucks where it is free). They should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. I have stayed at much better for less. Won't be coming back.
1,0,Truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid . Rooms are small; dirty; and in no way represents the web sites representations. Staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment. At best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in Chicago; "please" avoid this one. I had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms.
1,0,They allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water. We called security twice for them to do nothing about the party. When they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes. When we called back nothing was done about it. My 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing. THEN we get up the next morning at 7:30 to get ready only to find that we have no running water. After the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep. They did not resolve this issue. They just keep passing my complaint to "managers" supposedly. It was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it
1,0,After reading the Trip Advisor reviews; I was expecting an exceptional stay. I was not impressed overall. The concierge; the view; and the hotel resturant were the highlights. The bed; although not horrible; was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home; and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person. I was traveling for business; and although not dressed in formalwear; was also not dressed down; but all in all; it felt a bit pretentious to me. There are better options for the money; and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place; Sheraton Towers; or Trump for the similar price and better stay. I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratings......not #1 in Chicago; in my book.
0,0,Amalfi Hotel Chicago - Amalfi Hotel Chicago; We traveled to Chicago last spring and stayed at Amalfi Hotel for three days. We will never come back to this hotel. We selected this hotel because we found many positive online feedbacks about it. But we had a very bad experience. It is one of the worst hotels I have ever been to. The bathroom of our room was too old and the sink was leaking causing the bathroom floor to be wet all the time!! We reported the problem to room service and they were very apologetic but they refused to change the room because there is no vacant room available. Also; the water pressure of the shower was too weak making it long to get a quick bath. The food was not so tasty and we had to wait 45 minutes to get our order. It seems that the staff are not organized and the management is ignorant. Never waste your money at Amalfi Hotel.
0,0,My husband and I recently stayed stayed at the Hilton Chicago and it was a horrible experience. When we arrived; the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and didn't even acknowledge us for at least five minutes. When we got to our room I went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow. I'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty; so I pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs. I called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes. The second night we were there we decided to try the Irish pub in the hotel called Kitty O'Sheas because my husband loves pub food. We had the shepherd's pie which was awful. It was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap! Our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check. While we had a great trip to Chicago; the Hilton was definitely NOT a highlight of our trip. Overall; we had rude service; a dirty room and bad food. Spend your money elsewhere
0,1,I walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that I would have a wonderful stay in Chicago. After walking around the city all day; I was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place. The service was friendly and I especially liked the location. What a Treat!
0,1,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower; " I went to Chicago last month for a conference and enjoyed my staying at Sofitel. At first I booked there simply because the location was really close to where the meeting was held; but later on I was impressed by more than great location. The room was so spacious that I was able to do some abs workout the night before the conference to refresh myself a little bit. The room was also very quiet; which made me sleep really well. Breakfast was excellent; especially their omelets. The service was also pretty good. There was a very helpful concierge girl who directed me and my friends to a really nice bar (forgot the name) the night before we left. Although the conference was not that exciting; discovering Sofitel Water Tower made me feel good about the trip because I would't have a hard time making decisions next time I visit Chicago. Totally worth the money."
0,0,I did stay in this hotel couple of days back and was a bit disappointed with it. The hotel did not quiet live up to the expectation I was indeed expecting. The rooms were dull and cramped with very small bed. The parking lot was small for a hotel of this size. Further the staff was not very welcoming. I faced problems with the room as it was a bit noisy and also due to the fact that the elevators were close to my room. The dining hall was packed and had to wait in the lounge for quiet sometime. The refrigerator made loud and clunky noise which was fixed later. Different beer and wine were served rather than the one that I asked for. However the location was good and housekeeping did a good job. Overall I would prefer staying at another hotel for the same expense.
0,0,The Hard Rock should stick to restaurants. After a recent stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago I think they should go back to what there good at. Besides having to wait an hour for my room to be ready (this is after my check in time); the receptionist was very rude and seemed to not care that I was being delayed. After seeing the state the room was in I still do not understand what took so long. The sheets look to have been picked up off the floor and returned to the bed. The bathroom looked as if somebody had just used it (I will leave out the details). Complaining didn't seem to get me anywhere; they offered me a small discount at the hotel's bar. After this experience I will be more likely to book at a Motel 6 then return to the Hard Rock.
0,0,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower; "I went to Chicago last month for a conference and booked Sofitel Water Tower because it was close to the conference location. After my trip; I kind of regretted of this decision I made. There was nothing too special about this hotel except location; and the location was really not worth $300 per night. Some of my friends were staying in hotels a little bit far away but much cheaper; and it was really convenient to take the cabs. I pretty much stayed in the conference for the whole day; and all I did in the hotel was sleeping. But I was not even able to enjoy the only thing I did there. My room was cold and VERY humid; and the bathroom smelled disgusting. The bed was not comfortable too; which woke me up twice in one night. Absolutely not worth the money I spent."
1,1,My friend and I stayed for just one night; and loved the hotel. It had an awesome water feature in the hotel; and great large bar. Like all Hyatts it had a very comfortable bed; lot's of pillows; and large bathroom.
0,1,Upon arriving to the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago; I was immediately impressed. The staff was friendly and checked us in quickly; which is important to me after a long trip. Our room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style. The bed was very comfortable; including the linens which felt high quality; unlike what you get at some other hotels. All this made for a great night sleep. Perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the Hard Rock Hotel was their "Party like a Rottweiler" package we added to our reservation. For an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats; toys and best of all the pet cam! We left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iPhone! All in all this was a great place to stay and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet.
0,1,The stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation. Sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home! The accommodations and hotel are beautiful. I especially enjoyed the gym. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home.
0,1,The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb. the room service was exemplary and the food; I don't even know were to start. The chef obviously knew what he was doing; I especially loved the seafood; my personal favorite was the shrimp. Aside from this; I loved how beautiful the hotel was. It is definetly a bargain for the price; for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but; I felt as if i was in a $10;000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe. great bang for your buck. Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city. My friends actually went their a while back because of me. They loved it! I know you will too.
1,0,I stayed here with a dozen of my friends; and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs! We stayed there from September 28 - September 30th; but the symptoms (i.e. the crazy itchiness) didn't come until Sunday night when we all got home. I complained to the hotel and basically all they're gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills. Honestly; they should reimburse us; because it was not worth it at all. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!
1,0,I stayed at the Hilton Chicago last week and was very disappointed. The highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. Finally; my 72 year old mother; 8 year old son; and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. The security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me. The valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us. As far as I could tell; he was just standing there doing nothing. I couldn't let go of the bags without everything falling so I gave my son the parking receipt. The attendant pointed to where our car was parked - no short distance away. My 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up. They should have been ashamed. Less significant; but irritating issues. The pool is part of the Hilton Athletic club. Two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim. Basically; two adults can take up 2/3rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 1/3rd. This is ridiculous and very family unfriendly. In addition; the pool closes at 9 p.m. What pool closes at 9? We stayed for 3 nights. Not one single additional bar of soap; bottle of shampoo; or coffee stirrers.
0,0,Hyatt Regency Chicago seemed like a nice place to stay; but we didn't like it very much. The renovations were cheap and poorly done (our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it.) The staff was RUDE! I was trying to find a good cab service; and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call! Couldn't he have at least called someone else to help me? The "Babies Travel Lite" gave us the wrong sized diapers; so we had to go find some anyway; and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way.
1,0,I've been here for 4 days. Great location right off of miracle mile; near all major hotels; best shopping and theatres. Rooms very large. Hotel staff very friendly and helpful; and respond immediately. Problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on Superior between St. Clair and Michigan Avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities; and just about everything is in walking distance from here). At night; the street on the north side of Superior is dark; and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. The street people do not approach you; although they may stare as you go by. Usually 2 or more along the way; where they sleep on the window sills of Neiman Marcus. I would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (I am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) There are homeless up and down Michigan Street; but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. The entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work; and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. For now; expect two extremely small; warm; slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm; cramped hallways! All the walls throughout the hotel need painting; and the wallpaper is peeling in places. In the room; several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection; the carpets were stained; the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible); the TV is very small (16 Inch?) and the windows very; very dirty. You won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it; sometimes more than once. The "pub " downstairs is run down; dark and kind of creepy. Food and room service are very expensive; as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet). On the plus side; the bed was very comfortable; there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area; plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans St. Clair street toward the north and south. You can see a sliver of Lake Michigan. Pool small; but clean. All in all; it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room; but I think it is overpriced; and I would not stay here again.
1,1,We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion. The room was clean and new feeling; nice city view; free bottled water in room upon arrival. Check in was a breeze; and our room was ready even though we were several hours early. All staff was friendly and helpful; excellent breakfast.
1,0,Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. The "amenities" were a smoke screen; nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn. I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. Being charged $15/day for Internet on top of a $250/night rate was a bit over the top. The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head; unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. The staff were friendly and helpful; actually the best part of the stay were the staff. All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room.
0,0,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower – I stayed at Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for a weekend last September. Now; I had a several bad experiences with this hotel. I arrived just one hour earlier than the check-in time; but I was not allowed to check in; so I had to leave my luggage at the reception area and walk around on the street to pass the time. Luckily; the weather was good so I enjoyed my walk. My room was cleaned nicely; but I was on the third floor so I didn't have any view of the city. There was free internet access; but the speed was extremely slow and made it almost impossible for me to work and communicate online. I tried several times and finally gave up. The bathroom was certainly large; but I did not enjoy the shower due to the low water pressure coming out of the shower head. The part that I was most frustrated by was the cleaning lady who came early in the morning around 8am (despite my DO NOT DISTURB sign); and I was woken up by her knocking on the door. I would not recommend this hotel to others.
0,1,Hotel Omni Chicago- My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a long weekend last April. It was the best weekend I’ve had in a long time! From the fancy dining room; the excellent guest service; to the relaxing pool we had everything we could have wished for to make our stay a memorable stay. When we got to our suite the room had everything we needed: Lavender soap; shampoo; conditioner; a hair drier; even an ironing board; Wi-Fi and a flat screen TV. There was nothing missing! Our dinner was also amazing. Not only did they have a vegetarian meal; but they also replaced the potatoes with carrots and peas—of course free of charge! The fitness room was also amazing; they had several treadmills and a warm pool. When we went to the pool after dinner we were the only people there so we were able to enjoy the peace and quiet. Before we went back to our rooms we enjoyed a long walk along Michigan Avenue; passing by the shops; park and the art museum. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a wonderful stay in Chicago!
0,0,A recent stay at the James Hotel-Chicago; revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. Although the rooms and public areas look nice; the hotel still needs serious work. Our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. We asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. We had to involve the Manager before our request was granted. The new room was better at first glance; but was severely lacking. We could not get the temperature properly regulated. The room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. In a hotel commanding the rates of the James; we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted; not something which is a constant battle. Our mattress was horribly uncomfortable. When the rooms were updated; the James skipped new mattresses. Ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can't get out of--when you lie down; you sort of sink into a hole. This matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury' hotel. Last; but not least; we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. In spite of the calming decor; the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night's sleep. All in all; we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. You will be happier almost anywhere else.
1,0,They rave about their beds but the beds were average. On surface room seemed clean; however; dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust. It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall. The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole. Impossible to have a decent shower or bath. EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water. I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor. Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death. There was even a $10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room; really! For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity. Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity. I have already been charged for him to deliver the food. The parking fees were outrageous at $51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public. Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing. I reported the theft to the hotel. Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days. It has now been over two weeks. No follow up; no apology even given. We will never stay at this hotel again. We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at.
1,1,We just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel. We really have nothing bad or negative to say about it. We've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt; The Peninsula; and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel tops them all. It's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices. It's a beautiful hotel all the way around. Staff is uniformly friendly without being patronizing. They were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly. The common areas are fresh and modern in appearance. The room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths. My wife loved the huge tub. We had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious. The robes and Evian at turndown was always appreciated. The property is ideally situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk. Want a Bentley or latte? They're all close by. This was our second stay since it opened and I'm sure it's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago.
0,1,O.M.G best hotel ever ! i've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish. evan at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed ; how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . ohh . and the pump room ; the best food i've evr had at a hotel . i evan got to take a picture with Queen Anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid's stayed here . and it's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs . ( all the places to be at least )
0,0,When you’re paying over $350/night for a hotel; you’d expect a world-class experience and amenities. Unfortunately; I got no such thing during my stay. True; they have tons of space and features like a ballroom; gym; and bars; as well as a great location within walking distance of the Navy Pier. But the pros end there. I was honestly disappointed with our standard-sized room; which definitely made you feel like a second-class citizen compared to the club level guests. There was a shower but no bathtub; the room was on the small side; and I didn’t even get a lake-facing room. When I opened the pre-stock fridge I was disgusted to see nothing but expired fruit inside. I mean; do they even inspect the rooms at all? Worst of all; however; was an air vent near the bed that constantly let in unwanted noise at night. I tried to contact the hotel manager about it; but all he offered were points in their loyalty program. How useless! Outside the room there were problems as well. Yes; there’s a pool; but the water was absolutely freezing; and to make matters worse; I was unable to find a towel for over an hour; and so here I was freezing my butt off waiting to dry off. The gym was ok; but was very small and dirty looking with way too many treadmills and not enough weights. I’d much rather go for a run outside by the beautiful lake; admittingly one of the finer points of Chicago. Do not go to this hotel simply because of the pretty interior you see in brochures and their website. You will regret it.
1,0,The location of this hotel is excellent. The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion. The room decor is horrible (probably more European than I am used to) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment. On the upside; if you want to stay in a great location; feel safe; and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work. I prefer Westin or Marriott...something that you can count on.
1,0,After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel; I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness. I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels; particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF. I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club. When I arrived at the hotel; there was no separate check-in line (as advertised) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. They gave me a room in the "modern" tower; (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins (built in '29). I had to deal with torn sheets; cracked marble sinks; and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that? The closet door; if you are not careful; may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service; which never happened. The next day; they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room; but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room; I declined. To their credit; they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member. I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago. There are other better places for the money including; the Omni; The James; The Fairmont; Hyatt; Sheraton; Monaco; Crowne Plaza; even the Holiday Inn and Marriotts located in the same general area.
0,0,On a recent work trip to Chicago I stayed at The James hotel and I can't say I would recommend it for anyone trying to get work done while staying there. My main problem was that I could not get a reliable internet connection to their wifi in my room (and there was no wired connection to fall back to) and even when I managed to connect to the network the connection was very slow. I ended up having to use the wifi in the lobby of the hotel. The restaurant was that great either but the hotel is well located so it easy to find something better in the neighborhood. Other than that; the room was good and had a nice view. The staff were polite and tried to help me with my internet connection issues.
0,0,I don't know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others. This hotel was for me: over priced; fingerprints on the walls; stains in the bathroom; funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning; parking/valet was time consuming; and same thing with the elevator. The back to the 1960's furniture is not for me; and what about the breakfast? Better to skip their protein-less stuff they had to offer. Oh sure it is a Hilton; woopee! You pay for the privilege of sleeping there. Saw a couple of bed bugs; but took a shower in the morning; and they seemed to wash away. I won't be back to Hilton Homewood Suites again. I'd rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money. Think that I'll be happier as well.
0,1,This fantastic hotel has it all: luxury; an excellent location and a fun atmosphere. The rooms are spacious and well decorated; and the staff is always helpful and courteous. Whether you're traveling for business or fun; I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. I stayed there with my wife recently; we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun. The Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for. The hotel is in a central location; within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city; however; there's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for; so there's barely a need to leave to hotel! (well; we DID leave the hotel to see the sights; but you know what I mean). My wife and I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities; including a relaxing massage. This hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way; and we'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the Windy City.
0,1,Fantastic Hotel! Upscale and luxurious; and in a great location! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty! The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean; the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for! My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities. I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone; and can't wait to get back there myself!
0,0,We stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city. Although the hotel looks nice; the service is terrible. The staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all. The room service closes at 8pm so don't plan on getting hungry after that time. Also; even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries. I will never go back to that place
1,1,This was a great hotel right in the heart of the Chicago Loop. Within walking distance to the downtown attractions. Parking is expensive ($50 p/nt) so we parked at a free remote location (recreation drive) since we weren't planning on driving once we checked in. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and clean.
0,1,We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel. We found it conveniently located on E. Superior Street; near many local attractions. The rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel. The pillow menu was awesome; my partner and I have such different preferences; the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. The hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect! I couldn't believe the amenities available to guests. My Beagle; Betsy enjoyed her stay at the "Jet Set Pet" care center. She was pampered as much as I was. It was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership! Another feature I personally enjoyed was the Walking Tour Kit. It included an iPod Shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist; a deck of cards; guidebook that included walking tours; and comfort items like a towel and map! I felt like I was the most important guest (surely; everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms). Highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an Affinia Hotel!!
1,1,We stayed here as an alternative spot for a friend's wedding. The price was about 50% to 65% of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area. First the minuses. 1.) The standard rooms are small. if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade. 2.) Since the hotel has been recently rehabbed you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted. 3.) There really are no views from the hotel. Now the plusses. 1.) The shower is AWESOME. Probably one of the best hotel showers I've seen. Rain shower with wand; great pressure and the enclosure didn't leak like a lot of these shower stalls do. Very nice. 2.) The fixtures and finishes in the rooms were top notch. Very modern and clean. 3.) The bed was great. Better than some hotels that promote their beds. Great nights sleep. Overall. This is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room. If you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work. Anyone else should really like the experience. All I care about when I travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to relax in after a long day. If you are the same this is a good spot for you.
0,1,Best hotel in an excellent location I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a Business purpose. My 1 year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room. The front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly . The room service was also good. The room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good . I like the decor of the room. The French restaurant in Sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining . I will surely prefer to stay in Sofitel on a next time travel to Chicago.
1,0,Staying here currently. Had aspired to sleep. The paper thin walls allow even the slightest peep from your neighbor to feel like you're right in bed with them. Couldn't sleep anyway because of the cheap; giant fluffy pillows. Called housekeeping; asked for any help...was simply and accomodatingly told; after my plea for help; could they; would they have any ability to supply me with a reasonable pillow? Complete answer before hanging up: "We do not." Hyatt; may your well executed service lead to your demise. Happy
1,1,My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount. The valets were really friendly; you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel. Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level. That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street. The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative. Our room was very clean. The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants; storing and reheating food. The complimentary breakfast was great! They have real food such as eggs; bacon; french toast; cereal; bagels; juice; milk; and yogurt. The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue. They also have free WiFi. Overall; I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others.
0,1,swissotel - We ended up booking swissotel at the last minute for Christmas; and I was a little concerned that there were still rooms open. Fortunately; the experience turned out to be great. It was right next to the pier; which made for an excellent view. The room was spacious and beautifully decorated. We spent one night in and went to the hotel's restaurant. The salmon was incredible. The only issue I had with this hotel was that we couldn't stay longer.
0,1,James Chicago - After an exhausting flight; it was a pleasure to decompress at the James. Room service was prompt and surprisingly good; I recommend the 12 oz. NY strip steak. I was pleasantly surprised that I slept through the night without being disturbed as I am a very light sleeper; they must have lined the walls with noise-suppressing padding. I found only one annoyance: the shower head was a bit low-downc but what else can you expect when youfre six-foot-six.
0,0,Talbott Hotel - My family and I had a disappointing stay at the Talbott. The excellent location and reasonable rates are what drew us to this hotel;but that was it. Apart from the location and rates; everything was terrible. The rooms were very old and not at all modern and were very dimly lit. Upon checking the bathroom; I saw that the shower head was rusted. Also; we were hardly able to sleep at night due to the loud construction noises coming from the street. Furthermore; there is no gym facility available on site. But the most disappointing part of our stay was that we never got housekeeping services until we specifically asked for it. I would not recommend the Talbott at all. Save yourself the frustration and stay somewhere else.
0,1,Amalfi Hotel - We had the pleasure of staying at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago. Its location makes it a gem as it is close to down town. We liked their novel idea of serving breakfast on every floor. It makes breakfast quite accessible. The bathroom was clean and the staff was very cooperative. The staff even remembered our names that made us feel special. Amalfi also provides free internet which is fast and it helped me a lot as I had to prepare for a meeting the next day. We got wonderful view of Chicago river from our room and also the room was spacious and had a comfortable bed.
0,1,We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience! My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago. We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained; luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill. First of all; the hotel is all suites. We stayed in one of the "Premium Suites". The accommodations were definitely luxurious; with premium bedding; very nice robes for our use; and a choice of pillows. We used the hypo-allergenic ones; but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma; we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. There were actually two TVs in our suite. There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access; a wet bar; an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile; with so much to do practically at the Omni's doorstep. I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage; which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni. It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended. I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly; recommending several excellent area restaurants. However; we think our best meal was at the Omni's 676 Restaurant; where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass. They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance. Lastly; the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago; which was a highlight of our trip. We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni! We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future; where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again. We are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience!
1,1,The sheraton was a wonderful hotel! When me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap. We didnt want to get up! The beds are absolutely to die for. I wanted to take it home with me. The service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in. They had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food.
1,1,I booked this via Priceline; and was not sure I'd like it; as some Sheratons have fallen off the cliff. This hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations. Despite booking with Priceline; I was treated like a king. They let me check in early; gave me a beautiful room; and even went so far as to look up my Starwood number so I could get some credit for the stay. The staff was unfailingly pleasant; the property immaculate; and the room very comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel.
0,1,This is the best hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago. I travel a lot; both for business and vacation. The Talbott Hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome; and elegant. Not to mention all the modern features that I'm used to having at home; are available in the room. I brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite. She didn't even want to leave the room. The concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner.
1,0,This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure. The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners. The decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a Le Meridian. While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula; the Four Seasons; the Ritz and Park Hyatt; it falls short. We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection. While the prices were similar to the Peninsula; we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try. Wow; were we ever disappointed. First off; we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7. OK; thats fine and we sat down. The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong; so that she could make it right. When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full ($20 per glass); she consulted with the manager and then another manager (a heavier fellow in a dark suit). She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses. What bothers me is not the outcome; but the fact that the management is not service focused. At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula; this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure; it would be made right. At the Conrad; the Terrace manager just ignored it.
0,1,The Hilton in Chicago was awesome. The room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional. One of the features I liked; was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless; considering my laptop is not wireless; it help me out alot. Food was very good; quality was great. There was also a flat screen in my room...awesome. The hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning. I also enjoyed the gym very much. Overall; I enjoyed myself; and I will stay again at the Hilton when I return to Chicago.
0,0,I stayed here last August and I'm truly glad that I will never have to stay here again. The website does a great job of creating an illusion. The rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website. I thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt. The wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow. For such a "classy" hotel; there isnt a pool. At $46 per night; the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests. All and all; I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
0,0,The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly; yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly. The staff seemed miffed and stuck up; and I had to wait for the personal check in. I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited; and other guests (all single or couples without children) seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in. This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two; even though it is advertised as such. I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising; Amalfi.
1,1,I stayed for just one nite at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other TA posters but I was not let down. I got the room via PL @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. Since I had nothing to lose; I asked to be moved to a "room with a view". The front desk attendant( Rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room I had at first was clean and was in order and I assured her that it was. She then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. I was quite surprised as I have heard that they treat PL and Hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. The new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the Navy Pier; a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of Lake Michigan. All this for $70? Yep! I skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! The room was comfy; had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. I didnt use it since I wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. The bed and pillows were very comfy; but I awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but VERY WARM and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. This was a great deal for the price and I would absolutely stay here again.
1,0,My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel; and found the hard rock had lost our reservation. I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone. The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying. It wasn't until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue. Ten minuets later she found our reservation. Our room wasn't ready; we were told that it would be ready at noon; we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty! Room was very small. The bathroom shower; sink and floor were filthy. Room service trays sit in the hallways all day. The next morning we called down to get towels; they were never brought to the room; we had to drip dry. The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher. He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub.
0,1,This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at. From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food; Amalfi really exceeds its standards. The in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible. I highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5/5 stars.
1,0,While the parking service was great - the front desk was terrible. We had a huge problem getting ice one night - we had none in our room so we went twice to get some - no one was there to help; called the front desk they promised to deliver some - none arrived so we called again - they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened. ...read more
0,1,Homewood suites Chicago: It is situated in a very good location being at the heart of the city. The staff of the hotel are quiet friendly and the rooms are good to. The rooms were spacious and even the spacious balcony provided a place to just relax and wind up in the evening with a good view of the city. I was also happy with the parking space available. The rooms were clean and well equipped however the decor needs updating. The Wi-Fi was intermittent which was a bit disappointing but the problem was fixed later. The laundry was done the same day which added a nice touch to the overall feeling. Overall it was a pleasant experience.
1,1,Stayed at the Monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic. Very convenient for walking to museums; shopping and park nearby. The room has a great box window that you can sit in and enjoy the view. We also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and uniqueness of the hotel. Helpful staff; wifi; Aveda products; decent restaurant downstairs for brunch; easy to get a taxi and nothing beats the location. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel; for business or pleasure.
1,1,my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york. The room was very spacious and clean; the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. I really liked the Aveda bathroom products; great smell. We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot. Compliments to the chef. The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy pier; directions were given to us accompanied by a map. The weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show; this was spectacular. The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy pier and the Millenium park. Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping. If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here.
0,0,This hotel was very poor with customer service. They were so worried about keeping everything up to date and perfect looking in the hotel they rarely worried about their customers; and their guests. I had to ask for my room to be serviced for cleaning; and it took a long time to get a response. Very disappointed.
1,1,Was slated for two nights in Chicago; June 12 - 14; 2007. I could onyl get the Intercon for both nights. I booked a handicapped room since that was they had left. After reading other reviews of the property; I decided to move it from two nights to one; and stay the second night at the Hotel Monaco. Of course; upon check-in; I was given a suite. Nice room; great linens; clean bathroom; and very quiet. Parking is really high ($48). I understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated; but everything was clean and worked well. At ;ost; the rooms were a bit dark. I had a late night drink at the bar; which was reasonably priced. i did not eat there; but the menu seemed pretty good; albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected. In all; I thought the place was everything I needed; and was very happy with the room; the staff; the linens; and the housekeeping. Much better than others have indicated.
0,0,A few weeks ago we stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago. The hotel was a bust from the get go. As we arrived in the lobby; we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up. (We could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes.) When she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful. We had to wander around the halls looking for our room. Once we got to our room; we thought the weekend was going to get better. The rooms are modern and nicely designed. That was about all that this hotel had going for it though. As soon as we started to explore the room more; it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before. The bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it. We called a worker and they cleaned most of it up; but the thought of it still remained. As we all settled down to sleep; there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door. After about an hour; we finally made a call to the front desk to complain. The woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in Chicago. They were staying there the next 2 nights. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone! It's a hard rock hotel all right. (At least that's what the beds feel like!)
0,0,Affinia hotel in Chicago was one of the most interesting hotels I have ever stayed in. Everything looks very nice and fancy; though the people that work there must be from the projects of Chicago. The customer service was the worst I have ever experienced in my life! When we went to check in; first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in. When the women at the counter finally acknowledged us; she was smacking her gum; and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her! The room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast; and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude. I would NEVER go back; and I hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business.
0,1,ï»¿Hotel Allegoro Chicago - The bedroom decor was a bit over the top for me but the beds were very comfortable and we had an excellent view.  The bathroom was very clean which was a plus and it was nice to be able to bring along our dog. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone especially those traveling with pets.
0,1,Hotel Monaco is simply amazing. I travel quite a bit; and am use to generic hotels; with horribly unimpressive rooms; and "5 star amenities" which usually mean a packet of instant coffee; and room service that won't serve after 9pm. Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive. The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. This hotel has such personality. My absolute favorite part of my stay; aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs; was the in-room spa treatment. Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. Generic just won't do anymore.
1,0,So...the location to the Clark/Lake train stop is great...and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel. The wall are very thin...so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway. There is no coffee maker in the room; however; free coffee is available in the lobby...becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally; the "business center" is a pay for use set-up...no courtesty internet usage or printing. Lastly...they bathroom is micro-tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort.
0,1,If you're looking for luxuary; look no more. The Conrad is the best. I was in Chicago on business; and had to stay much longer than anticipated. A coworker suggested this hotel and boy am I glad he did. The location is perfect; you're close to everything. The best part is the Conrad is a smoke free hotel. I'll be back soon. Very Satisfied
1,0,All I can say is avoid this place at all costs. From the reservations assistant (who took 45 minutes to book a room) to check out (they billed my card for 750 dollars) and getting a refund (numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call). AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again; and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement!
1,1,My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists. What a beautiful hotel! Our room was lovely; the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient. They don't have an in house gym; but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there. We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel; as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods. There are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping. There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott (they are building condos right behind it); but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago.
0,0,What I hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare. The first sign of trouble at the Affinia was that they couldn't find my reservation. Add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked. The internet service was so slow it was unusable. To top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible. Finally; I discovered the valet parking; which was a $49 premium service; dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car. I highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit Chicago.
0,1,My husband and I stayed at the Omni after attending a wedding that took place there. We were delighted at the luxury of the rooms and the accomodations were wonderful. Everyone from the concierge to the housekeepers were friendly and professional. We were extremely pleased with the whole experience and look forward to our next trip to Chicago so we can stay there again. And; by the way; the wedding was absolutely gorgeous!
1,1,I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got. The room was pleasantly decorated; functional and very clean. I didn't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt. I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district.
1,0,We had reservations (guaranteed by credit card) for 2 nights this past weekend. When we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town. I asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning. They sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us. The night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way. Eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the Sheraton for the transfer - something we were never given. Eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didn't work we found out that the night manager of the Sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel. So once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the Sheraton. In addition to all of this; we had to pay $24 for parking at the Sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation. I am still shocked by this bad experience.
0,1,Hard Rock Hotel - We stayed here in March; and this place really blew me away. It's only a few blocks away from a train station and a subway stop; so we didn't have to walk far in the 20 degree weather\'85 Yikes. I was on an upper floor; so noise wasn't a problem and the view at night was spectacular; but my friend said hers was a little noisier. I guess just ask when you make the reservation. The bathroom was a little cramped; but the room itself was sizable. We were going to go to the lobby bar for drinks before heading out for the night; but they didn't have very many tables for bigger groups. We ended up going to Chuck's Manufacturing instead; which had some really fun cocktails and was surprisingly big for a hotel restaurant. The concierge gave us directions to this amazing Lebanese place for dinner that was only a few blocks away... Can't remember the name now; but just ask her; it was awesome!
0,0,Don't let the website fool you. I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago on my last business trip; and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel I've ever stayed at. The website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it's more on par with a 2 stars or 3; if you want to be generous. First off; the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture. The room that I checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls; and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since god knows when. Since I was only staying one night; I decided not to ask for a different room- although I don't know if asking for a different room would've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. When I arrived; there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement; no prompt service. I had to wait about 3 minutes although I was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. And no; they weren't talking about hotel matters. I'm not a difficult or an especially picky person; and who doesn't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism. Do yourself a favor; and go stay at the Marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for.
0,0,This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere. It smells because pets are allowed. This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed. There was mold in our room and bathroom; pet hair everywhere! Kids love pools. How can they claim to be kid friendly without one? My kid was bored. The food was basically the same every day; no variation in the menu. Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their "travel club" because our room didn't even remotely resemble the pictures. They did the old bait and switch. We reserved a "family room". When we opened the door of our room; we realized that it wasn't what the website pictured or had what the website described. We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers. Definitely do not recommend this hotel!!!
1,0,It's not a bad hotel. It's just so...disappointing. As a Diamond member; I expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view. I'm not distraught over this; but come on. Ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge; which has nothing but fattening pastries; bagels and cereal. Low-level Hampton Inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame. And what's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am? Business travelers often need to be GONE by 6:30; not sitting down to their meager breakfast. The in-room wifi is a pain to access; and I somehow got stuck with the $19.99 plan even though I selected the basic plan. (Don't get me started on how a $89/night Hampton Inn can offer free wifi and a full-service Hilton & Towers seemingly can't...). Finally; what's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? It's an unseemly waste of space; especially when the rooms are so meager. And the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992; not 2009; as does the picture-tube TV (vs. flat panel). Overall; this is a huge disappointment over which Conrad should be ashamed.
0,0,I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago. Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 (one!!) front desk agent 30 minutes to process. Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding; it seemed; wrong room types and being out of the room type requested. I was nervous about my own reservation and; sure enough; my Superior Corner room wasn't available. The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available. I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel. Want internet? Upcharge. Want extra pillows? Upcharge. Extra coffee for the room? Upcharge. Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating. I won't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking.
1,1,This is a stylish hotel located right on North Michigan Avenue; a five minute walk from the Orange "Loop" line that will get you to and from Midway Airport. Forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. Our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft; we were told). Decorated in grays and white; the room was comfortable and soothing; not jarring. On the other hand; we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading; finding keys; etc. No kidding. The bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. On the positive side; however; there were Aveda products in the bathroom; the windows were huge; so during the day there was tons of natural light; and no issues with darkness. The king size bed was very firm; but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. We had a largish TV with a DVD player. There is a safe and munchies. The gym is perfect; equipped with treadmills; ellipticals; bikes and weights. It is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. There are towels; water; headphones; disposable ear pads; and complimentary green apples. Suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd; take the elevator up to 22nd; then down to L2 to get to the gym. This way you dont have to traverse the lobby. The front desk staff is amiable; and very attentive. I read some other reviews about nasty personnel; but did not have that experience at all. I got a free newspaper with a smile; a free stamp when I needed it; change and all the coffee I could tolerate in the morning. The Hard Rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the Water Tower; the Drury Theater; John Hancock; and magnificent mile. For those who like a thrifty breakfast; we recommend Gourmet Pantry at 155 N. Michigan Avenue [--]. This deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a Sunday morning; no less: $1.99. The hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person; but we did not partake of it. We would stay at the Hard Rock again; and think it is great for people with "tweens." Not sure about the toddler set; though.
1,1,We stayed in a king suite at the Hotel Allegro over Memorial Day weekend. We paid $130/night; and it was definitely a bargain. The suite was huge - living room with a couch; two chairs; desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. The room had recently been renovated; and was very clean. Comfortable bed; friendly staff; great location (near the train and bus); evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. While the Allegro isn't a five-star hotel; it is a great place for the money. (Note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room; and reported that it was very small. Upgrade if possible).
0,0,I've stayed at other hotels in Chicago; but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience. First off the staff was incredibly rude. I could have lived with that being that it was busy; but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out. The room was also horrid. It smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that I was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair. There was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain. Mark my words: Never again will I stay at this dump!
0,0,Fairmont Chicago Millenium Park - This hotel might be the last hotel I might turn to in Chicago. I could say that the room was not bad; but I couldn't help bouncing around like a ping pong ball inside the room. Of course this would have been fun for kids like 3 generations under me; but obviously I'm not one of them. Having a bed that just takes up space in the middle of the room made the whole experience stuffed.
0,0,I stayed at the Affina Chicago for my anniversary. The hotel is in a great location; but that doesn't make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff. It looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet. I spent more money than I would normally; hoping for a luxury experience; and left very unsatisfied.
0,1,The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel is perfecty located in the center of downtown Chicago. Whether you are going there for business or pleasure; it is in the perfect place. The rooms are large and beautiful and the ball room took my breath away. The wi-fi connection was perfect for the work I needed to do and the show at the Navy Pier was perfect for when I needed a break. Other hotels have nothing on the Hyatt. I just wish there was a Hyatt Regency in every city for all of my business trips.
1,1,Stayed here for two days while attending Lollopalooza music festival. One of the best locations in Chicago; on Michigan Ave near the Tribune and Sun-Times buildings. An easy walk or bus ride to many attractions. The King sized room was very nice; not large; but with a generous bathroom. Service was excellent throughout. Check out the awesome swimming pool; straight out of twenties.
0,1,I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers a couple nights ago. The service was excellent!! As soon as i stepped through the door they grabbed my bags; and were helping me choose the best hotel room for me! I loved there service and the room was gorgeous! I highly recommend it for anyone; and there prices aren't as bad as others. I loved the experience and I'm sure next time I'm in the area I'll visit again!
0,1,This is a great place to stay while visiting Chicago. My husband and I went over the holidays to see my family and we stayed at this hotel. We could not have asked for nicer people! Everyone was always smiling and very helpfull! We usually stay at the Ramada...but will never stay anywhere other than the InterContinental Chicago hotel again! - Casey L. Skinner
0,0,I stayed at Swissotel Chicago for 1 night while on vacation with my girlfriend. Our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate. We walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in; we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel. Once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention; she got off the phone and acted like I was the one at fault. Needless to say I will not be staying here again.
0,0,What I thought was going to be a romantic Chicago Weekend turn out to be lackluster. The Swissotel Chicago per their website seem to tout itself as a luxury destination well much to my surprise it was not. First my reservation was messed up instead of getting "the classic room with a view" we were put in what I guess is their classic king. The view was nothing to write home about. When I called the front desk to complain about the situation I was told their was nothing they could do since the hotel was booked solid. I asked how could this happen when I got a confirmation? The clerk simply said "probably a glitch sorry is there anything else I can help you with?" At the point I hung up the phone as I knew our romantic weekend with a view was not going to happen. When we checked out I told a manager what happened and He said there was nothing we can do sorry" I expected a little more customer service from them since they think of themselves as a luxury destination.
0,0,Omni Chicage Hotel - A friend and I stayed at the hotel over a weekend. The experience was really disappointing. We paid $250 a night while staying here; only to realize we were being charged $300 when checking out; as they did not mention the additional parking charges right at the start. The staff was not helpful in the least; saying that it was mentioned earlier. The room was quite spacious; though wasn't well kept. The bed linens for one were not very clean. To add to that; the bathroom lights were not working; and required to be changed while we were staying there. Also it’s located near Northwestern Memorial hospital; and the ambulance sirens you hear at night are a nuisance. I thought the stay at the hotel was not worth it; as we had a really bad experience.
0,0,We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference. I have to say; normally I am very easy going about amenities; cleanliness; and the like...however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review. Truly; DO NOT stay at this hotel. When we arrived in our room; it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. I figuered; "okay; it's just the carpet." Until I saw the bathroom! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e.; a paper band across the toilet; paper caps on the drinking glasses; etc.; it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place. There was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and; I kid you not; the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things "appear" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. Well; the Hilton was proof. I called downstairs and complained; and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. Frankly; I found the room disgusting. The hotel itself; outside the rooms; was cavernous and unwelcoming; with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this. When I got home; I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not; such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. Please; do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel.
1,1,I want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service. 1) Sylvia Rollins; Head Concierge. I wanted a fairly last minute reservation at MK restaurant. I spoke with Sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation. 2) Ryan Lettier; Concierge; provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises. Our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and Ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the Monaco. 3) Turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4) Even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel. The rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal Hotel Monaco feel. Beds and bedding both very comfortable. The complimentary happy hour and morning coffee/tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests.
0,0,The Ambassador East Hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart. As i was staying for a few nights I notied may problems with the service of this expensive;cold hotel.First the room sevice was poorly helpful; the bag boy insisted on a tip; and also droped my bag. The chefs cooking was terriable;the steak that I spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare; but came to me burnt. The room was not what you pay for; the beds were like a sack of rocks. And to top it off the covers smelled like smoke. I will never give the Ambassador East Hotel another chance.
1,0,Excellent Hotel ! Rooms and service were great. A great value ! I have been to places that are not as good for nearly twice the price. Good location. Close to the L and short walk to rental car service. Restaurants in the area a bit of a disappointment; but the shopping was great. Area recommendations Great theatre; restaurants; museums and shopping.
1,0,Just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the Swissotel Chicago is the one for you. My wife and I went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door; this year there is a loud construction site next door. So 8 am Saturday morning you will hear the workers starting. I am sure once the summer in Chicago comes around they will work all night. Just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the Navy Pier. Now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete. On top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own. The front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was. The protestors were there because the Swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers. If you ask the workers about the noise and they say we can't hear it. I am sure the Swissotel does not want word getting out about this. If you insist on trying it for yourself don't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck.
1,1,we stayed here in january when it was -20. but even then we enjoyed it so much we could not wait to get back. chicago is a great town to visit and the homewood suites is the place to stay; period. now we stayed from the 9/5/2009 to 9/5/2009 and enjoyed every day. (p.s. the weather was in the high 70s). to get back to the hotel; it was fantastic; it has everything you need and its write in the heart of the city. two seperate rooms were very handy as we had our teenage son. full kitchen; (laundry on 7th floor) seveal foodmarkets within walking distance; everything within walking distance. you wont need a car and at $42 for valet parking you wont want one. dont take my word for it ; check it out you wont be disappointed. oh and did i mention free breakfast and dinner . job done. its a no brainer book now. p.s. theres also a beach within walking distance
0,1,My husband and I recently traveled to Chicago on a mini vacation. We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in the downtown area. This hotel is simply beautiful. From the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left; we were treated as if we were royalty. I have never been treated so well. We were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs. We stayed in a Superior Corner Suite. The view of the city was the most amazing thing I had ever seen. The rooms were very spacious and clean. The king size bed was extremely comfortable. The room didn't seem like we were in a hotel; it had the feeling of home. There was a separate living room area which was wonderful; my husband and I just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline. It was mesmerizing. We ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping; which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping. Most everything is in walking distance. The food was to die for; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant. We did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge. The lounge had a classy feel to it; very relaxing yet sophisticated. We even received a massage; in our room. While we did have all the conveniences of home; such as internet and TV; we did not even think about using them; being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives. This was the most romantic vacation my husband and I have ever taken. I cannot express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel. We had other options but I am so glad we decided to stay here. The rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience; which the experience itself is priceless. I will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel.
1,1,Had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the Palmer House. The service was wonderful; staff was very friendly towards dog owners; even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was. Easy access to red line from Midway. Valets were prompt at retrieving car (they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting).
1,1,I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. We stayed in room 1112; King with River View. No noise and very comfortable.The price was a bargain at $191 a night. I would stay here again. The "L" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel. It's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride.
1,0,I have been meaning to write a review of the Omni but wasn't sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high. We stayed here for 5 nights. The room was fine when I walked in. But about five minutes or so I was all congested. Thought it might have been from the flight. I then noticed there was dust everywhere. The TV; the Minibar; and worst of all the air vent. It was literally hanging off the vent. I called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up. After 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things. A bathroom door that wouldn't close; broken light fixtures; a toe or fingernail on the bed. broken bathroom fixtures. This place was a dump. Hopefully the pictures will show some of it. I could go on and on. Almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room; Both he and head of housekeeping were "shocked" at the room. We were moved to another room; not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked; or so I was told. I stayed at the Omni once prior and have to say was very impressed. But this will be the last time. Sad to say. The hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay; but doesn't explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection.
0,1,First of all when you check in the check in process is smooth and takes no time at all; the front desk is very friendly and kind and make sure you know where your room is. Then on the way to your room they have spots with chairs and a table to have a seat and visit with other guest if you prefer to be out of you room. The room it's self is very spacious and clean. The pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel; they never seemed to run out. The service is beyond exceptional. I would recommend staying at Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown to anyone.
1,0,We stay at the Palmer House when we attend conferences in Chicago. It is a stately building. But this year; there were ... problems we have not had before. First; they now have wi-fi available; but it is not free. The cost is $7.50 per hour. On-line it indicated that Hilton hotels charge about $4; but this was almost double. Many hotels have free wi-fi. Wi-fi is wi-fi; so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. They also charge for their fitness center; even when you are only going to use the machines. There is no business center in-house for copies; etc. Our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. It did not separate us from the bathroom noises. When someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.); the pipes "sung" like old pipes do;but very loudly. An empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. The concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. If you called down; you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. The staff were all very nice; and the location can't be beat; but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. I doubt we'll return....
1,1,We arrived at the Omni on 2nd September for a 6 day stay. I took ill when I left the plane after travelling from Manchester so I saw more of the room than I anticipated. I couldn't go out for 4 days. The room was spacious and clean. The bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom was large and very clean. What more could you ask. We had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. I managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) Having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. A few sunbeds on a concrete floor. There was also noise from an air conditioning unit. It could do with a bit of cheering up. What I saw of Chicago was very pleasing; it has something for everyone. Would I go back to the Omni? yes I would.
1,0,We recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago illinois; while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here. I payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for incedentals ($50.00) the next day my debit card was charged $200 clearly this had to be a mistake...i called the hotel manager who was the rudest person i have ever spoken with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account; routing; SS # and authorization code and he could call my bank and take care of it. Clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged. I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake. I then questioned them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already credited my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me. So for your bank accounts sake do not stay here they are many other options in chicago
1,1,Named my price on priceline. $50.00 Bucks. Hotel room was great. Clean; Clean and new. Fresh crisp sheets; comfortable bed; flat screen TV; clean carpet; nice bath; etc. Short distance to food and sightseeing. I highly recommend this property. Be prepared to pay over $40.00 per night to park. Hey; Its a hyatt. They also charge $5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck. For a total of $100.00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just don't drink the bottled water. Happy Travels
0,1,I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. The service was impeccable. Not only was the staff attentive; they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great; and after an open bar the night before; the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there.
0,0,swissotel - My husband and I were visiting Chicago for our third anniversary. We read a lot of the reviews beforehand and thought this would be a great place. Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to the expectations. The room wasn't ready when we got there; so we had to wait an extra 30 minutes. The bed was very uncomfortable; and the bathroom was unkept. The only thing worse that the room was the food they served at the restaurant. We had the seabass which gave my husband food poisoning for half of the trip.
1,0,What's not to like? --> Problems getting the room you actually reserved: I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved. --> Overcharging. They charge for everything here. Wireless. The Fitness Center. The Business Center. I've only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center. Note to the Intercontinental: If you're going to charge for something that is commonly included; you should advertise that fact. What's next? Charging for sheets on the bed? --> Very poor customer service. The staff does not communicate in full sentences; or wait to hear your answer. This is Chicago; not New York. How about a little Midwestern patience?
1,1,The Omni Chicago really delivers on all fronts; from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on Michigan Avenue. While this address in Chicago requires a high level of quality; the Omni delivers. Check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes; the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events; and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in Chicago. Even the "standard" room has a separate living area and work desk. The fitness center has free weights; weight machines; and two rows of cardio equipment. I shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! All in all; a great property!
1,1,We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean; hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing. We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny.
0,0,The Talbott Hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome. If you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel. The room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside. The cost is far more than the luxury. The best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels.
0,1,My family and I stayed here while we were visiting Chicago. This was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around. It was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations. The staff was friendly and went the "extra mile" to make sure we had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable. We would definitely stay here again.
0,0,I have visited Chicago with my family several times and have never had such a HORRIBLE hotel experience! The staff was rude and unhelpful; and they overcharged my card by more than $300! I had to spend the whole morning on the phone trying to get them to finally fix their mistake. The hotel itself didn't live up to our expectations either...the inside was dingy and needed cleaning; and our room looked like a bunch of chain smokers had just thrown a crazy party in the room. There were cigarette burns on the sheets; stains on the floor; and there was a hole in the wall where it looked like someone had punched it! We requested another room; which was only marginally better in terms of cleanliness; only to be kept up all night from the noise of our neighbors yelling and hanging out in the hallway. There are plenty of other places to stay in Chicago. AVOID Hard Rock at all costs!
0,1,talbotthotel - First trip to Chicago; found the Talbott online. Good location; easy access to public transportation as well as a short walk to Washington Square Park. Rooms were large and well-decorated; with tall windows and granite countertops in the bathrooms. The hotel restaurant wasn't cheap but the food was surprisingly good; and our waitress was very nice. Overall; I'd recommend the Talbott.
1,1,WOW!! Where do I start? Booked this hotel through Hotels.com for less than I paid for the Travellodge Downtown. Check in was a breeze; the entire staff was friendly and helpful. Our room was huge. The king bed was very comfortable. Our room also had 2 nightstands; 2 chairs with a small table; a desk; and walk-in closet. Even with all the furniture; the room was very spacious. The room did show some signs of wear; but I think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. The hotel is located in a neighborhood; so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. There is very little noise; however; you are only about 2 blocks from Rush and Division streets; with all the nightlife; and the Red Line at Clark and Division is only 3 blocks away. We decided to walk to Michigan Ave and the next thing we knew; we were at the Hancock building. By staying here; you are away from the noise; but not away from the action. Had breakfast at the Pump Room; which is a story in itself. We had our photo taken in booth 1. Take some time and research who has sat in this booth. It is impressive. Some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the Pump Room. Didn't have a chance to have dinner here; but I will return for dinner someday. Breakfast was not anything fancy; and a bit pricy; but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. The waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. I can't wait to return here!
1,1,I stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and LOVE it! The staff are great; the rooms are spacious and clean; and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. Plus if you sign up for Omni Select Membership (for free) you get free wireless internet access.
1,0,We booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown. We where woken up at 6:00 in the morning with our bathroom flooded; this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet. We where moved to another room; but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for. The next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets; coffee or towels; which is just horrible service. The service along with the orginal room where perfect; but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel.
0,0,Hotel Allegro – I cannot say enough about how terrible my experience was at this hotel. Upon arriving; I waited a long time for the lobby receptionist to give me the key to my room. When I finally arrived at my room; it was obvious to me that the room had not been cleaned properly. The food downstairs was nothing to rave about either. The main course came out cold; and the waiter was pretty rude. I will definitely NOT be coming back to Hotel Allegro. Last time I stayed in this city; I went to the Holiday Inn which was much better!
0,0,The hard rock hotel Chicago is not as good as they try to portray; First ill start off by saying there website is confusing and hard to navigate through. They also have rude customer service; that dont seem happy to answer your questions. There prices are so outrageously expensive for what they offer; its just ridiculous. Hard rock hotel has a good rep behind there name; but Hard rock hotel Chicago should not be included in that.
0,1,The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit. My wife and I utilized the park & play package; which gave us an amazing room; complimentary valet service; and a great kit to plan our weekend around. It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again. The rooms were top notch and the hotel's staff was excellent. One of the employees; Craig; helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests. We loved our visit and are sure you will too. A+
0,0,I stayed with my husband at the Homewood Suites in Chicago. We wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the Hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay. Unfortunately this was not the case! The staff was very rude at check-in (which took 20 minutes) and the lobby smelled musky and gross. The room itself was not like other Hilton hotels I have stayed at. The carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit; the room smelled of smoke (even though it's advertised as smoke-free) and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed! I was so grossed out that I had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it. And don't even get me started on how poorly the shower/bathtub worked..a nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is. If I could give it 0 stars; I would!
0,1,My wife and I booked a Deluxe Accessible Room at this beautiful hotel for three nights. The wonderful photos don't do the hotel justice. It couldn't have been a more ideal stay. The room was spacious and and clean; the bathroom sparkling; with every amenity one could imagine. The bed felt like it had been just delivered. Our views of downtown Chicago were spectacular. On top of all of this; the hotel staff was extremely helpful. They explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at; and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy! Believe everything good that you read. If you visit Chicago; stay at the Conrad Chicago.
1,1,This was my first time in Chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location. This definitely fit the bill. I could walk to all the places I wanted to see - very close to Michigan Ave and the Magnificent Mile. About a 15 minute walk to the Art Institute. The hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. There was coffee in the lobby every morning; that was very welcome. The room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. I could hear the train and some traffic from the street (considering the location; this wasn't bad and didn't affect my ability to sleep or relax). I would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem!!
0,0,My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I'll never ever forget - not in a good way. Check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. I went up to my room and looked around; all seemed ok at first. I was bushed so I flopped on the bed... ohhhhh noooooo! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days. But I was so tired that I just passed out. Of course I woke up with a back ache...great. I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub; turned the hot water on full force; and poured in some shower gel. I put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm. I called the front desk but they were no help; the clerk just apologized. Frustrated at this point; I turned on the tv and switched on the air. I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent. It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something. I couldn't take anymore of this. I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. It seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized; no empathy as if he's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. He offered me a free night but there is no way that I'd stay at this place again - ever.
1,1,My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and loved it. Our stay was booked for us by Virgin Atlantic when we booked our flights from London to Chicago. We were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the Hilton brand name. In the event we found that the airline knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel. On arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient. The interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the decor as it would have been when it was built. The room we were given was a good size with 1 Queen bed which was particularly comfortable. The hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. The first night we ate at the hotel's own gourmet restaurant (The Lockwood) which did not disappoint. The breakfasts are also served in this restaurant. We had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered. Generally we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful. A nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving. A member of staff supervising the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to assist us find the car when it did arrive. Overall I would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money.
0,0,The Conrad Chicago is a Michelin rated hotel; so I was expecting great service and wonderful accommodations. Well; only one part of that was correct. The rooms are indeed nicely furnished; but the service was terrible! The concierge was unable to find my room reservation (I reserved online and even had the email confirmation) and wasn't very helpful in getting me a new room. I ordered room service; and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold. I mean; I understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room; but really? For the price I paid; it was definitely not worth it; and I would never use this hotel again.
0,0,My wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this 'Luxury' hotel to any of our friends. Amalfi claims that your stay begins with a 'warm greeting;' but we received the exact opposite. The front desk clerk was rude; sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question; and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. Apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog; who we had to bring at the last minute. The room on the Pet Floor was alright; nothing spectacular; and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. We proceeded to dinner at Keefer's Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. I have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. The next day; I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly; and had to finish some work at our friend's house. My wife had called for some extra towels and pillows; which took about half an hour to receive. She also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. We were set to stay for 3 days; but only managed to stay 2. We will not be staying here again.
1,1,Great place; great room; great location. Even though there was a big meeting going on (Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns) the only consequence for us was slow elevators. Ballroom is amazing; shops on ground floor a nice throwback. Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it. Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent. Definitly would return.
0,1,The Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. Staying with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always; the room was clean and impeccably neat; the staff friendly and very capable. The wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too! Best of all; it is a pet-friendly hotel; something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. Thanks; Chicago Hilton; for a great stay!
1,0,When I called to edit my existing reservation; I was placed on hold for 30 minutes! Finally someone came on the phone and said; "Ill have to transfer you"; so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes. When I finally did get to speak to someone; as I was going through my changes; I asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off. Before she was able to disconnect with me; I said "I have one more question" to which she replied "I'm working at the front desk and I have customers waiting!" I thought; so am I not your customer? pathetic and rude. Hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay.
0,1,Intercontinential Chicago Hotel - This hotel is amazing. I usually have pretty high standards for hotels; but this hotel has exceeded even my expectations. It is right in downtown Chicago and close to several really well known restaurants. The rooms are gorgeous; the bathroom is so spacious and the room was laid out such that it felt very spacious. The view from the window was amazing and the management was top notch. I wasn't sure what to expect when I read the reviews but I took a chance and booked a room; I'm really glad I did!
0,1,We really enjoyed our stay! It is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff is helpful and polite. They had great suggestions on where to eat; what to do; etc. We were within walking distance of many great Chicago locations like the Navy Pier and Art Institute. The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable; I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great home away from home in Chicago.
0,0,I have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel. The Omni Chicago's age shows; and not in a "great ambiance" way! The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking. I say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor; almost like mildew; that permeated the first room we were given. Seriously; it brought tears to my eyes! The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma; but finally agreed to switch us to another room. The new one didn't smell; but was clearly past its prime. Housekeeping was almost nonexistent. We had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels. How can you forget to leave towels for the guests? I'm not one to complain; but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here; we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment. We received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago.
0,1,My stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel was wonderful! I had a last minute business trip; in downtown Chicago; and this is the first place I looked at. I looked at the pictures they show online of the rooms; and the facility itself; and I simply fell in love with the place. The indoor pool; outdoor sun decks; massages; this place really has all you could possibly need; whether you're on vacation; or needing a little stress relieved from a busy week. I mean they even have high speed wireless internet! I would definitely recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel; if you want a great place to stay near Downtown Chicago!
0,1,To whom this may concern; my name is Jamie Brown; and i was a recent guest of yours between July 4th through July 10th; and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave. The Kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine; helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to. The free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well. I really couldn't have asked for anything more! I felt like a queen and I never though I could feel that way just staying in a hotel. I thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and I will gladly be visiting you again very soon; only for more pleasure and way less business. Sincerely yours; Jamie Brown
1,1,My wife and I stayed here in the middle of February 2005. We took the (EL) subway to the hotel from O'Hare. It was very convenient. The lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable. I've stayed in many a hotel room; this bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in. The hotel is located in a great area and close to everything. Walking distance to almost all the interesting sites Chicago has. Would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city.
0,1,A few nights ago; I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago. I'd heard some amazing things about the great food; and how friendly the staff were. Upon arrival; the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time! The rooms were cozy; with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. I ordered breakfast the next morning; and had room service bring it up. The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering; and was delicious! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling; or any families staying in Chicago; as the rooms were very reasonably priced; and is a short distance to lots of great sites. Next time I come through Chicago; I will definitely be staying here!
0,1,Chicago Hotels: The Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers - First; the Sheraton Chicago is definitely in a fantastic location. It's right next to the river and only a few blocks from the lake. In the other direction its right next to Michigan Avenue so we could walk to almost everything we wanted to see. The hotel's accommodations were also great. The bathroom and bed are quite comfortable and also clean. On the downside the internet was not free and the fridge automatically charges you when moving items so I was not able to put my drinks inside but I would still highly recommend this hotel.
0,0,Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. At first once coming into the room; there was a mildewy smell in the air; which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. To make matters even worse; the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon; when my wife was back from exploring the city. This was simply unacceptable by any standard.
0,1,This hotel was worth every cent. You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here. In town for a conference; my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything. Fine dining; entertainment; you name it: Knickerbocker's got it! I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family.
1,0,This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby. However; when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. Wireless internet is available; but that's an additional fee. Are you kidding? Even the roach motel offers wireless for free! Also; the fitness room was available for only $15 per day. Wow; I thought the room rate was enough to cover that. When I used the coffee supplies in the room; they were not replenished. I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up. No kidding; nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar! Glad I wasn't in a big hurry. I'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time I'm in Chicago!
0,1,My husband and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago and we can't wait to go back! The hotel is located in downtown Chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city; we were close to everything. The Hard Rock Hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking. The room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings. The bed was heavenly. The hotel staff was friendly; upbeat and extremely helpful; we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both. I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and I would stay there again in a heartbeat.
0,1,Hilton Chicago - The room itself wasn't anything too special; but the view of the lake was great. Some noise could be heard from the neighbors but it didn't prove to be too much problem. What made the Hilton Chicago hotel great are the exceptional dining options they offer and the various activities you can do here ranging from swimming to fitness and visiting the aquarium or museum.
1,0," Barely Average Hotel at Premium Price" This hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby. I have stayed in the Conrad in Dublin; Ireland and in HongKong both of which I loved. I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. I was extremely disappointed. I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name. Pros: Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location: Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments - Stained and worn out carpet in hallway - Room was small - Phone and lightbulb in room were broken - Breakfast was $60 for two people; service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo; one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days; I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel. and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct. I would not stay at this hotel again; It just is not worth the premium price they charge.
1,1,Stayed there three nights from 4/17/09 through 4/20/09. Chechecked in about 9:15 AM. Had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests I had made. Room was quiet; and comfortable. Marked improvement over last time I stayed there (about 5 years ago). The renovations were great; and maintained the old time charm of the hotel.
1,1,I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for one night - I'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals. I checked in late (almost 10pm) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- Atlanta. I took the shuttle to the airport (best option in lieu of the over priced taxis); and it was my first time staying at the hotel. Upon arrival; I immediately noticed the entrance; which appeared very welcoming and warm to me. I checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if I'd prefer a king or double (reconfirming my reservation preference). I always take the king when I can; and the bed was fantastic! It was suited with great linen and these incredible down & feather pillows named Encompass made by The Pillow Factory -- I checked the tags; since I plan to buy some! I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria; which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and YES; it does stand out all on it's own. The food is Asian fusion; and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie; I appreciate great food when I taste it! The hotel service was good as well. Only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. They missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet; which tasted a bit 'metallic'. But they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I passed on the buffet. I would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view (if you can get a room with one); fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet.
0,1,I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter. The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me. Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services. Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I'd been in years. My room was clean and modern; yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding. I'll certainly be staying with them again in the future.
0,1,http://www.amalfihotelchicago.com/ - The Amalfi Hotel is a wonderful; decently priced; experience. The rooms are large; pleasent and comfortable. The hotel provides free wifi and DVDs; which is a plus; but the movie selection is rather lacking; mostly comprised of children's films. Breakfast was simply the best food I've had in a long time. Highly recommended!
0,0,The Palmer House Hilton; while it looks good in pictures; and the outside; is actually a disaster of a hotel. When I went through; the lobby was dirty; my room hadn't been cleaned; and smelled thoroughly of smoke. When I requested more pillows; the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she'd send them up. It took over an hour for 2 pillows. This hotel is a good example that what you pay for isn't always what you get. I will not be returning.
1,1,Excellent location; feels like a boutique hotel. Right next to Neiman Marcus (V.expensive dept store) and 2 mins walk to John Hancock tower. As most American ;medium to high end; hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception. Upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment. The pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a Beer. They will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as I feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling
1,1,After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo; I decided to give this hotel a try. I must say it was a great choice! The location is perfect; just off from N Michigan Ave; walking distance from everything. The staff was very helpful and friendly; and the room was excellent. They gave us a corner room w/a great view. As many have posted; the bed & pillows were very comfortable (I am very picky about that). I slept well every night! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. I highly recommend this hotel.
1,1,This was a weekend trip for my friends and I. We booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way. Our rooms were right next to one another as requested. As it was almost everyone's first time to Chicago; we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel. And; our choice was next to perfect. I had an amazing time during my first visit to Chicago and it was largely due to this hotel. The customer service was AMAZING. Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. One of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm; and delicious. My friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too. In another of our rooms; housekeeping had accidentally discarded a CD when replacing the CD player with an iPod dock. The concierge had the exact CD purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store. Our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic! Everything was freshly made in their kitchen too. An added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall. Therefore; you don't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes; a coffee; or a some other type of trinket. I was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation.
0,0,The Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it. First of all; it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare. If you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you. When I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in; and I thought the wait time was ridiculous. To make matters worse; I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room. Two hours later they managed it get to work; the connection was still very slow. For my part; the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations. I was disappointed and will never stay there again; if I go back to Chicago. If was rating it; I would give it 1/2 star out of 5.
0,0,My family stayed at this hotel and walking into the Lobby I expected a very good experience. Once I made my way to the counter and was Greeted (Not Really) I knew this may be a bad experience. The Customer Service Person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes. Once I got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out. The High Chair that we requested still had spots of food on it. The Rest Room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper. After we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid. Luckily we only had to stay there one day. One day was almost too long.
0,1,the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The room service is the best in the area; not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for. The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary. This is a great place to take the family to relax. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 5 stars!
0,0,I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel. Me and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be. When we walked in the door there was a horrid odor. Almost like a public bathroom. The check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative. She would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet! When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting. The beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks. After the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast. The food there tastes and looks like vomit. The rest of the weeks stay there was like living in Hell. The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel is definitely not a good place to stay. It is actually probably on of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at.
0,0,I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July. For a "luxury" hotel this place did not meet my expectations. For starters; we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn't be ready for at least another hour! I'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee. Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel's restaurants; Kitty O'Sheas. Well; we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks. Once we finally got to our room it was OK; although not great for the price. We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view; and there were not extra towels as I had requested. We had to call room service twice to receive them; then another two times because our air conditioner wasn't working. Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone. Next time I'm in the Chicago area I won't be staying at the Hilton. I'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money.
1,0,My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool; one white phone and one emergency red phone; to call the desk. Both were out of service!!!! I am glad there wasn't an emergency. As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
0,1,My experience at the Hyatt Regency Chicago was simply amazing. I had a wonderful stay there will my husband. My husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go; and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there. They were able to provide us with a Hyatt allergy-friendly room. We were so relieved and the room was beautiful. The furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil. It was the most comfortable stay we have ever had. On top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business; so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient. We took full advantage of the 24 hour room service. I will definitely stay there again. It is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room.
