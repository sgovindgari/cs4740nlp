 <r> <s> 0 I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied . <s> I arrived to find that they had  " lost "  my reservation . <s> They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation . <s> After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in . <s> He was almost helpful . <s> He searched the database and found that there was a  " cancellation "  ;  however ;  it was not for the type of room I had reserved . <s> I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days . <s> I was given a box with a bed in it . <s> They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation . <s> Unfortunately ;  I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked . <s> I had no choice but to accept what they had offered . <s> I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here . <s> Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything ;  even if it was their error . <s> <r> <s> 0 Amalfi Hotel Chicago - We stayed at Amalfi Hotel Chicago last July for a weekend . <s> It is a contemporary boutique hotel with a perfect location in downtown Chicago . <s> It is close to most interesting attractions in Chicago area such as museums and shopping centers including Magnificent Mile ;  Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue . <s> We enjoyed every minute of our stay . <s> The room and its bathroom were clean . <s> Mattresses were comfortable and staff was polite and very helpful . <s> We especially enjoyed the great continental breakfast ;  which was offered in a nice and shiny hall . <s> Also this hotel has a good selection of dishes for lunch and dinner . <s> My only complain is that we had to wait in a queue for about 10 minutes to check in on arrival day but this was minor issue given the great experience we had at Amalfi . <s> We will definitely stay again at this nice hotel when we are back in Chicago next summer . <s> <r> <s> 0 We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close ! <s> What I didn't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable . <s> I can't remember when I got a better night's sleep . <s> The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept . <s> We'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we're in town ! <s> <r> <s> 0 My family and I recently attended a wedding in Chicago and stayed at the Swissotel . <s> It was much nicer than we expected . <s> We are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this ;  by far ;  was one of the nicest places we've stayed . <s> The beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - I was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib ! <s> The bed sheets were so soft that I wanted to take them home ! <s> We will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in Chicago . <s> <r> <s> 1 Overview :   -- Overrated hotel in a premium location . <s> The Great :   -- Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants ;  bars ;  and sights . <s> The Good :   -- Inviting lobby ;  pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby ;  in particular the night deskman . <s>  -- Nice bathroom ;  comfortable bed and desk chair . <s> The Mediocre :   -- Room  ( excluding bathroom )  was underwhelming in design . <s>  -- No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray's across the street . <s>  -- Free cocktails 5-7pm in  " lounge "  is right idea with wrong execution ;  tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door . <s>  -- Hot water  ( or lack thereof )  - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm . <s> Pressure is pretty low . <s>  -- View - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible . <s> The Bad :   -- Free wi-fi  /  ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day ;  even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating . <s> Same deal for my iPhone . <s> I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is . <s>  -- No blackout curtains ! <s> I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning  ( not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night )  . <s> Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I've ever stayed at . <s>  -- Noise ! <s> - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling ;  bar music ;  trucks ;  car horns ;  and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning . <s> I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor . <s>  -- TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel . <s> And the remote was useless . <s>  -- In room bar had standard inflated prices but the  $ 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting . <s> Don't even think of opening it ;  there's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost . <s> Summary :   -- Not recommended . <s> Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is . <s> Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star . <s> <r> <s> 0 How should I start ? <s> Well ;  after staying at the Ambassador East Hotel ;  i realized it was my favorite hotel ever . <s> The rooms are amazing . <s> The food is great . <s> The Pump room bar is awesome . <s> I love this hotel . <s> If your ever in Chicago ;  the Ambassador East Hotel is the place to go . <s> <r> <s> 1 We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time . <s> Small rooms ;  but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene . <s> Lots of interesting amenities in the room . <s> Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping . <s> Really loved the lobby  --  a great place to hang around or wait for someone . <s> Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere . <s> Watch out :  The concierge  ( like all concierges at big hotels )  will direct you to mediocre ;  large restaurants where they get kickbacks . <s> We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago . <s> However ;  the hotel is often full so book early . <s> <r> <s> 1 I stayed at the Fairmont during a professional conference . <s> While I have to say that for a conference ;  some of the meeting rooms were too small ;  in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional ! <s> I can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect . <s> The accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many Chicago attractions . <s> <r> <s> 0 This hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price ! <s> It has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses . <s> We loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers . <s> They also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner . <s> The fitness center was very clean ;  I didn't want to leave it ! <s> Our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included ! <s> And I took advantage of the free grocery delivery . <s> Beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated . <s> But the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff . <s> We will be back to the Homewood Suites the next time we come to Chicago ! <s> <r> <s> 1 After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed . <s> I booked through their web site about 2 1 / 2 months prior to arrival for  $ 170 / night plus tax for a room with 2 queens . <s> The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave .  - minutes walk to the El ;  Millenium Park ;  the Theater District and Shopping . <s> The room was clean ;  a little larger than standard and nicely decorated . <s> We had window seats in the room with a view of the river . <s> There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening . <s> To top it off ;  the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area . <s> <r> <s> 0 On our first trip to Chicago ;  my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel . <s> In the past from other  " luxury hotels "  we have paid much more and received much less . <s> Here the room were very spacious ;  comfortable and sleek . <s> We spent come time in the hotel bar ;  LE BAR ;  and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none ! <s> We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time . <s> If traveling with a lover we recommend the  " Air of Romance "  package . <s> It was the best ! <s> 6 stars ! <s> <r> <s> 1 I have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood ;  cost and amenities . <s> The hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open ;  you wouldn't know it . <s> You need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock . <s> The beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a  " nicer historic hotel . <s>  "  I will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime . <s> It was a very frustrating experience . <s> <r> <s> 0 I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . <s> While higher priced ;  the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . <s> Granted the hotel itself is beautiful ;  but looks can be deceiving . <s> The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . <s> The restaurant  ( Cafe Des Architect )  had amazing food ;  so that was a plus ;  but the service was awful . <s> I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! <s> My remote wouldn't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . <s> The hotel must've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . <s> The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . <s> I called twice for more fresh towels . <s> If I wanted this type of experience ;  I'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel . <s> Same experience ;  less money ! <s> <r> <s> 1 I only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night ;  however enjoyed my stay . <s> The staff was friendly ;  the room was nice and clean ;  the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant . <s> Room service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great . <s> The staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room . <s> Great location too ! <s> Walking distance from the Art Museum ;  Millennium Park ;  Grant Park  ( right across the street )  and a quick cab ride to McCormick Place . <s> If I were in the city again I would love to stay there again . <s> <r> <s> 1 The Hard Rock is glossy and sexy ;  but an absolutely fantastic hotel .... <s> I was in town for business and stayed here because of it's location ;  but I absolutely understand why tourists would like it ... right on the river ;  cool art deco building and Millenium Park is just down the street . <s> Regardless- the room was clean ;  the staff was friendly ;  but NOT annoying and the bar was fun . <s> I was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were GOOD ! <s> I'll definitely try it again ! <s> <r> <s> 0 If you are looking for a luxurious downtown Chicago experience ;  the Conrad Chicago is the place to stay . <s> The rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding ;  a 42 inch flat screen television ;  a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub ;  and views of downtown Chicago that will take your breath away . <s> The hotel has many amenities for you to enjoy while you are there including great restaurants and bars ;  high speed internet ;  a fitness facility and laundry services . <s> This hotel was a great place to stay and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown Chicago . <s> <r> <s> 0 When I planned my summer vacation ;  I was wanting to travel somewhere new . <s> Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life . <s> I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel . <s> It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there . <s> The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues . <s> The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious ;  I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied . <s> I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town . <s> I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later . <s> <r> <s> 0 The Ambssador East Hotel - They were out of rooms with king-sized beds when I checked in ;  so I was stuck with a small bed in a room with two beds . <s> I didn't even receive any compensation for the trouble . <s> I usually rely on the light to wake me up in the morning ;  but I made the mistake of sleeping on the bed further away from the windows ;  so I woke up late the next day . <s> The bathroom's big enough ;  but housekeeping doesn't replenish the supplies everyday ;  which is annoying . <s> The restaurant's too expensive ;  so I was forced to leave the hotel to get dinner . <s> I wouldn't stay here again on my own money . <s> <r> <s> 0 My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it . <s> The atmosphere was very chic  &  upscale ;  in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank . <s> My wife even got to bring along her dog  ( aka  # 1 man !  )  . <s> I would definitely stay here again  &  would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area . <s> <r> <s> 0 I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for business ;  but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it ! <s> The accommodations exceeded my expectations . <s> My bed was very comfortable ;  the room was big enough ;  and the shower was so relaxing . <s> I had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at J's express . <s> The fitness center was clean ;  and inspiring . <s> I will recommend this hotel to others while in the area . <s> <r> <s> 1 I have stayed in hotels all over the world ;  and this is probably the worst service that I've ever experienced . <s> The staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would . <s> I decided to try the Monaco because it seemed interesting ;  was close to the theater ;  and had what seemed to be a good rate . <s> What a huge mistake . <s> The front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful . <s> The room was not clean ;  the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving ;  they never bothered to come turn down the beds ;  and the late check-out  " priviledges "  which were guarenteed when I booked the room suddenly became  " upon request "  - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful . <s> Dont' waste your time or your money here . <s> At best ;  it's nothing special . <s> Personally ;  I like the Fairmont in Chicago ;  but anyplace woudl be better than the Monaco . <s> <r> <s> 1 I can't recall another time I've had to deal with such rude front desk help . <s> While pleasant initially ;  as soon as I demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that I was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in  ( I arrived prior to check-in time ;  so they were holding a few bags )  ;  the true quality of this establishment surfaced . <s> Never mind that the luggage wasn't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7 : 30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop . <s> While that was a bit annoying ;  the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of Donna ;  the very attractive but aloof front desk employee . <s> Her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness ;  as I noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay ;  including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning . <s> I also booked a rate that included parking ;  which Donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately ;  I assume after I got on her bad side . <s> Even with my last polite good bye to the front desk ;  I felt a phony ;  uppity attitude from Donna ;  and I really can't convey the extent of how insulting it felt . <s> I can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to Chicago . <s> The hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy . <s> Great location as well . <s> To be fair ;  most of the staff seemed very friendly ;  and I am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier . <s> But I think most travelers ;  like me ;  would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service ;  so as to not have a  " situation "  that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience . <s> Unfortunately ;  that was the case here . <s> <r> <s> 0 Overpriced is the best word to describe the Conrad Chicago hotel . <s> While it may be in downtown Chicago ;  the room had no view . <s> Although I asked for non-smoking ;  the room reeked of smoke . <s> The elevators were very slow ;  and one was not working during my stay . <s> There was a stain on the pillow ;  and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken . <s> There was a dead bug in the bath tub . <s> I was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay . <s> My credit card was billed twice ;  and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge . <s> I do not recommend this hotel at all ! <s> <r> <s> 0 I stayed in the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago last week ;  and I was extremely disappointed with my experience . <s> The breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked . <s> I came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted . <s> Also ;  the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm ;  having been kept out on the counter . <s> I would have been better off bringing my own food ! <s> Also ;  the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward . <s> I had to move the furniture around to be able to watch TV ;  and then move it back before I could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways . <s> I could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed . <s> It just wasn't what I would expect from a Hilton-brand hotel suite . <s> <r> <s> 0 I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton's famous hotels . <s> I gotta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to . <s> In fact ;  Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet . <s> I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape . <s> In fact ;  the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early . <s> I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel . <s> I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room ;  they ignored me . <s> How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? <s> One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo didn't look like the actual logo . <s> It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw . <s> I'll never go to this hotel again and it won't even be in a million years for that matter . <s> This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer . <s> <r> <s> 1 This hotel was wonderful ! <s> I am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it ! <s> Pros :  THE FRONT DESK and THE STAFF !!! <s> -Helpful :  Knew great places to eat and HOW to get there Breakfast :  Pastries ;  coffee ;  tea ;  muffins ;  etc :  Fresh Drinks + hors d'oeuvres :  Yummy !!

 <r> <s> 1 From checkin to departure a poorly run hotel . <s> It took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty . <s> Another person ;  perhaps the manager ;  was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew . <s> The hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors ; especially when 1 of the 3 breaks ;  as seems to be frequent occurence . <s> After specifically asking for a room away from the elevators ;  I was assigned to a room directly across from them ;  necessitating another 20 minute wait in line . <s> The room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night . <s> I requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again . <s> Basically ;  the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained . <s> Never again  !

<s> The bathroom was too small and smelt moldy . <s> The indoor pool was very crowded after dinner and was definitely not large enough for a hotel with 347 rooms . <s> We were going to talk a walk along Michigan Avenue ;  but when we got outside we noticed the lights on the sidewalk weren’t working and it was completely dark . <s> I will definitely never stay at the Hotel Omni Chicago again ! <s> <r> <s> 1 The Ambassador East is located in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago . <s> It is just a few blocks from the train station ;  so it was easy to get anywhere in town . <s> The hotel is a National Historic Landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful . <s> We loved the Pump Room bar with tons of B  &  W photos of celebrities . <s> The service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful . <s> <r> <s> 1 Very centrally located in the Loop directly south of the 7th Day Adventist Church  ( my room looked down upon Wacker Drive ;  the aforementioned church and the Chicago River . <s> Small room ;  virtually no storage space . <s> Attended a conference with the Monaco as venue . <s> They provided adequate service ;  with no problems . <s> This was the first time I spent with a Kimpton Hotel and I registered for their Frequent Stay program . <s> I never felt comfortable in this hotel . <s> I'm 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age . <s> Rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender . <s> The young people can have at it . <s> I'll stay at the Marriott Michigan Ave next time . <s> <r> <s> 0 I was here on a weekend when there must have been a big convention or something ;  because I couldn't get a room at The James ;  where I usually stay . <s> Walking in ;  the lobby was gaudy and poorly lit ;  and the line to check in took forever . <s> The elevators were tiny ;  and about five more people than could actually fit squeezed their way in just before the door closed . <s> The chair in the room was uncomfortable and really low to the ground- I had to pull my husband up out of it . <s> The bathroom didn't have a bathtub ;  only a shower ;  and almost no room to put my toiletries to keep them organized . <s> The fitness center has mirrors everywhere to make it look big ;  but there were only about four treadmills ;  and you bet that every single one was full whenever I tried to make it down there for exercise . <s> It's a bit closer to the Loop than the James ;  but that didn't make up for its other problems . <s> I won't be returning . <s> <r> <s> 1 My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . <s> When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . <s> I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool ;  one white phone and one emergency red phone ;  to call the desk . <s> Both were out of service !!!!

 <r> <s> 0 Very nice hotel ;  better than expected . <s> The hot breakfast is great in the morning ;  but the Dinner at night goes above and beyond  ( even free wine ! <s>  )  The rooms are pretty good size ;  well furnished ;  and clean . <s> I liked the view from my room . <s> I used the fitness center and although did not have everything I would have liked ;  was adequate . <s> I will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view . <s> The staff was friendly and helpful ;  being my first time in Chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration . <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel . <s> <r> <s> 0 I was REALLY looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation ;  but unfortunately that was not to be had . <s> From the moment we arrived at the Omni ;  the staff was belligerent and extremely rude . <s> They had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before . <s> If we weren't so tired ;  we would've gone to a different hotel right then ;  but hindsight is 20 / 20 . <s> After we FINALLY got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby ;  we decided to go down to the pool ;  which was tiny and kind of dirty ;  so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing . <s> The internet access was really slow . <s> I will NEVER stay here again . <s> Save yourself the headache and book somewhere else !

Chad Montgomery ;  I was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate . <s> Anyone can make a mistake ;  so I wasn't too angry at that point . <s> My room was bland and colorless ;  in spite of The James' boasts of their attention to design and detail . <s> The room was mostly clean ;  but after seeing the stains on the bedding ;  I am not convinced that they were washed after the room's last occupant . <s> I attended a stressful business meeting in The Dining Room that night ;  complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy ;  disgruntled waitstaff . <s> Afterward I decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order . <s> I was assured that I would enjoy  " Asha's Purifying Shower Ritual "  ;  which would primarily take place in my own room . <s> The shower was okay ;  but I think I must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided ;  because I broke out in hives all over my body . <s> Next came the  " in-room "  portion . <s> While I was in the shower ;  five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room . <s> I guess they were supposed to make it smell good ;  but I began choking on the odor the minute I walked in the room . <s> My masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion ;  but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking . <s> I am sure certain areas are NOT on the massage menu . <s> In closing ;  if you have ever considered staying at The James Chicago ;  I beg of you to reconsider . <s> With only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel ;  and a suitcase full of negative  ( including a pending court case against the masseuse )  ;  I can almost guarantee you would regret staying there . <s> I know I do . <s> <r> <s> 0 Homewood Suites Chicago â€“ I travel to Chicago a lot and have never been as impressed with a hotel as I am with Homewood Suites Chicago . <s> When I stepped into my room ;  I was immediately hit with the Chicago skyline . <s> Food was easily accessible in the wonderful restaurant next to the lobby . <s> <r> <s> 0 I took my family to the Affinia Chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous . <s> My kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by . <s> My wife was really stoked with Spaffina . <s> The pampering and really made her feel special . <s> And they are very attentive to pets also . <s> My dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention . The hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels ;  so their Stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also . <s> My favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content ;  which left me free to go over to Underground Wonderbar for a nice cocktail . <s> <r> <s> 0 When most people think Hilton ;  they think luxury . <s> I know I did . <s> I only wish I'd been half right . <s> Upon arriving ;

 fine . <s> I was willing to let this slide . <s> I didn't want to be difficult . <s> In the following days of my stay ;  it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the Hilton very undeserving of the term ;  luxury hotel . <s> Noisy neighbors . <s> Rude staff . <s> If the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout ;  I doubt my sheets were changed even once . <s> Next time I'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper . <s> The service couldn't possibly be worse . <s> <r> <s> 1 Apart from the location ;  great ;  but it stops there . <s> Upon check-in ;  I was informed I would have a queen bed . <s> I asked for a king size bed ;  and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king . <s> GIVE ME A BREAK ;  a surcharge for going from a queen to a king . <s> When I got up to the room ;  it was like a oven . <s> I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service . <s> Everything in the room had a charge associated to it ;  even down to the coffee ;   $ 1 . 00 . <s> Now what's up with that ? <s> I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom . <s> Very small . <s> I have stayed there twice and with so many other options ;  I feel this will be my last . <s> <r> <s> 0 Whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas . <s> Most notably is cleanliness ;  as although the lobby was very clean ;  the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not . <s> Dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways ;  and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time . <s> The furnishings were nice and modern ;  but with various blemishes upon close inspection . <s> Bathroom was relatively clean ;  with the exception of the shower . <s> View was nice for this particular room ;  and service was relatively quick . <s> The food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue . <s> This time with the glasses which were stained ;  the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel . <s> I will not make the mistake of staying here again . <s> <r> <s> 1 Upon first entering the hotel ;  we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen I have ever encountered . <s> Through our 2 week stay ;  they told us to  " have a nice day "  as we left in the AM and welcomed us back upon our return . <s> Breakfast is served in the AM ;

 I heard several recommendations regarding lodging ;  but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically . <s> I expected an experience of comfort ;  luxury and customer satisfaction ;  but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel . <s> The design is breathtaking  --  modern ;  clean ;  stylish ;  sexy  --  and its reflected everywhere from the lobby ;  shops and restaurants ;  to the stunning guest rooms themselves . <s> My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in ;  and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor . <s> Far from a traditional hotel experience ;  this was like moving into chic ;  exclusive downtown apartment ;  and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living . <s> Impressive ;  too ;  was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources . <s> From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage ;  the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world ;  and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance . <s> It's a respect that shows through ;  too ;  in other areas :  support for artistic organizations ;  charities and other programs of merit ;  as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay ;  whether for a weekend ;  a week ;  or longer . <s> The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago . <s> In fact ;  we may visit again solely to stay at the James ! <s> <r> <s> 1 I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues . <s> Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day . <s> No fridge or microwave included in the price . <s> Our room had two too soft full size beds . <s> In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall . <s> Who doesnt believe it ;  check out the 16th floor close to room 212 . <s> With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous . <s> I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better . <s> The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty ;  but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served . <s> please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby . <s> <r> <s> 0 Hilton Chicago - I may be biased because my expectation for this Hilton hotel was high ;  but  $ 150 a night for an ordinary hotel room with no extra special services seems a bit pricey for me . <s> Aside from the price ;  the noise was also a big issue for me . <s> I couldn't get enough sleep with all the noise coming from traffic in the morning . <s> <r> <s> 1 We stayed for just one night  ; but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite . <s> The rooms were clean and large . <s> The decor had just been redone . <s> The best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night . <s> We got a great rate and would go back . <s> Great location for walking around . <s> <r> <s> 1 where do I start . <s> The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had . <s> Anthony -the Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable . <s> Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice . <s> He set me up and quoted me a price of  $ 125 ;  When i got to the spa  ( which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon )  i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was  $ 100 with 20 %  off . <s> At the end of the massage I gave the lady  $ 100 and said thanks you can keep the change ;  She insisted that I got  " A Hotel Rate "  because Anthony set me up . <s> She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference -  $ 45 . <s> She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined . <s> In short - shady dealings with this place . <s> I was quite taken back . <s> The GM Selman comp'd me a night but  ;  I felt swindled big time . <s> Stay somewhere else . <s> The concierge has something going on ... 
 <r> <s> 1 We stayed at Amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more . <s> It's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it's just not worth the money . <s> It does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast . <s> The sheets though ;  made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things . <s> The breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt . <s> Otherwise ;  it's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins ;  danishes ;  sweet breads ;  and croissants . <s> There are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety ;  if you are into that sort of thing . <s> Also ;  the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room . <s> The problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time ;  alternating between cold and warm ;  right over the bed . <s> There is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale . <s> They do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free . <s> The problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there . <s> One person at a time ...  All and all ;  we will not stay there again . <s> If we feel like luxury ;  we have to find some other place . <s> But if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city ;  maybe we will try Red Roof Inn or something like that . <s> At least we'll know what we are paying for . <s> <r> <s> 0 After staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently ;  I was nothing but disappointed . <s> This  " luxury hotel "  obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable . <s> When I arrived ;  my hotel room was devoid of towels ;  and after calling down to the front desk ;  it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered . <s> On top of that ;  when I went to connect to the internet in my room ;  the wifi signal was too weak and I was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop ! <s> For the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their  " superior corner suite "  ;  I could have stayed a week at a Holiday Inn ;  and after this stay ;  I wish I had . <s> <r> <s> 1 Stayed for a week last month . <s> Can't beat the location - close to the Magnificent Mile ;  Attractions ;  Tours ;  Great Restaurants  &  Night Life . <s> Have spent a lot of nights in other Homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels . <s> Thought the room was ok ;  not great . <s> Overpriced in my opinion . <s> Found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful . <s> Had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less . <s> Watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well . <s> Breakfast was the same stuff day after day . <s> As the week went on ;  they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished  ( weekly delivery I guess )  . <s> Also ;  the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant . <s> Travel for work  ( sales )  and frequently stay in hotels . <s> Travel with family every year and also stay in hotels . <s> This is roughing it for me ... not a camper . <s> Would come to Chicago again ;  but would not stay here . <s> There are too many other options worth investigating . <s> <r> <s> 1 I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok . <s> The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center ;  which is truly annoying . <s> In addition ;  there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator . <s> Other than that ;  it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm . <s> But ;  the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable . <s> The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk ;  and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed . <s> There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed ;  so they shoved it off to the side . <s> Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel . <s> It should not be sold as a hotel room . <s> <r> <s> 0 Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago- Horrible service . <s> Overpriced and lacking in service . <s> There are much better places to go in town . <s> When I first heard about this place ;  I had my doubts but decided to bite the bullet and go for the pricy choice . <s> I was on a trip with family and wanted to splurge on the accomodations . <s> However ;  when I came to the hotel ;  my expectations were far from being met . <s> The pictures posted online were deceptive and hid most of the flaws in the hotel . <s> The bathroom had mold all over and was really disgusting !

<s> <r> <s> 0 A recent stay at the James Hotel-Chicago ;  revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only . <s> Although the rooms and public areas look nice ;  the hotel still needs serious work . <s> Our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke . <s> We asked for a new room which was clean and odor free . <s> We had to involve the Manager before our request was granted . <s> The new room was better at first glance ;  but was severely lacking . <s> We could not get the temperature properly regulated . <s> The room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay . <s> In a hotel commanding the rates of the James ;  we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted ;  not something which is a constant battle . <s> Our mattress was horribly uncomfortable . <s> When the rooms were updated ;  the James skipped new mattresses . <s> Ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can't get out of -- when you lie down ;  you sort of sink into a hole . <s> This matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury' hotel . <s> Last ;  but not least ;  we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay . <s> In spite of the calming decor ;  the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night's sleep . <s> All in all ;  we were unhappy with our accommodations at the James Chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location . <s> You will be happier almost anywhere else . <s> <r> <s> 1 They rave about their beds but the beds were average . <s> On surface room seemed clean ;  however ;  dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust . <s> It appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall . <s> The repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole . <s> Impossible to have a decent shower or bath . <s> EXTREME water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water . <s> I was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor . <s> Also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death . <s> There was even a  $ 10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room ;  really ! <s> For room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20 %  gratuity . <s> Since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity . <s> I have already been charged for him to deliver the food . <s> The parking fees were outrageous at  $ 51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public . <s> Upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing . <s> I reported the theft to the hotel . <s> Had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days . <s> It has now been over two weeks . <s> No follow up ;  no apology even given . <s> We will never stay at this hotel again . <s> We have been to Chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at . <s> <r> <s> 1 We just got back from 3 nights at the Sofitel . <s> We really have nothing bad or negative to say about it . <s> We've stayed at other higher end hotels in Chicago such as the Park Hyatt ;  The Peninsula ;  and The Four Seasons - and the Sofitel tops them all . <s> It's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices . <s> It's a beautiful hotel all the way around . <s> Staff is uniformly friendly without being patronizing . <s> They were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly . <s> The common areas are fresh and modern in appearance . <s> The room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths . <s> My wife loved the huge tub . <s> We had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious . <s> The robes and Evian at turndown was always appreciated . <s> The property is ideally situated in the middle of the Gold Coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk . <s> Want a Bentley or latte ? <s> They're all close by . <s> This was our second stay since it opened and I'm sure it's to be our home away from home when we are in Chicago . <s> <r> <s> 0 O .

 <r> <s> 0 When you’re paying over  $ 350 / night for a hotel ;  you’d expect a world-class experience and amenities . <s> Unfortunately ;  I got no such thing during my stay . <s> True ;  they have tons of space and features like a ballroom ;  gym ;  and bars ;  as well as a great location within walking distance of the Navy Pier . <s> But the pros end there . <s> I was honestly disappointed with our standard-sized room ;  which definitely made you feel like a second-class citizen compared to the club level guests . <s> There was a shower but no bathtub ;  the room was on the small side ;  and I didn’t even get a lake-facing room . <s> When I opened the pre-stock fridge I was disgusted to see nothing but expired fruit inside . <s> I mean ;  do they even inspect the rooms at all ? <s> Worst of all ;  however ;  was an air vent near the bed that constantly let in unwanted noise at night . <s> I tried to contact the hotel manager about it ;  but all he offered were points in their loyalty program . <s> How useless ! <s> Outside the room there were problems as well . <s> Yes ;  there’s a pool ;  but the water was absolutely freezing ;  and to make matters worse ;  I was unable to find a towel for over an hour ;  and so here I was freezing my butt off waiting to dry off . <s> The gym was ok ;  but was very small and dirty looking with way too many treadmills and not enough weights . <s> I’d much rather go for a run outside by the beautiful lake ;  admittingly one of the finer points of Chicago . <s> Do not go to this hotel simply because of the pretty interior you see in brochures and their website . <s> You will regret it . <s> <r> <s> 1 The location of this hotel is excellent . <s> The hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion . <s> The room decor is horrible  ( probably more European than I am used to )  and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment . <s> On the upside ;  if you want to stay in a great location ;  feel safe ;  and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work . <s> I prefer Westin or Marriott ... something that you can count on . <s> <r> <s> 1 After reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel ;  I went ahead and got an Ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness . <s> I normally have a good experience with Intercontinental hotels ;  particularly the Mark Hopkins in SF . <s> I called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as Ambassador Club . <s> When I arrived at the hotel ;  there was no separate check-in line  ( as advertised )  and the manager on duty basically ignored me when I told him I was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room . <s> I was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty . <s> They gave me a room in the  " modern "  tower ;   ( built in the 60's )  which was about 2 / 3 the size of a regular room at the Mark Hopkins  ( built in '29 )  . <s> I had to deal with torn sheets ;  cracked marble sinks ;  and the spare roll of toilet paper being located OUTSIDE the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that ? <s> The closet door ;  if you are not careful ;  may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door . <s> I was not provided with a key to the minibar and I called for turndown service ;  which never happened . <s> The next day ;  they finally got around to the fact that I was an Ambassador Club member and entitled to an upgraded room ;  but since I travel with a medical device which I already set up in the tiny room ;  I declined . <s> To their credit ;  they did send some of the amenities I would otherwise be entitled to as an Ambassador Club member . <s> I would not stay at this hotel next time I go to Chicago . <s> There are other better places for the money including ;  the Omni ;  The James ;  The Fairmont ;  Hyatt ;  Sheraton ;  Monaco ;  Crowne Plaza ;  even the Holiday Inn and Marriotts located in the same general area . <s> <r> <s> 0 On a recent work trip to Chicago I stayed at The James hotel and I can't say I would recommend it for anyone trying to get work done while staying there . <s> My main problem was that I could not get a reliable internet connection to their wifi in my room  ( and there was no wired connection to fall back to )  and even when I managed to connect to the network the connection was very slow . <s> I ended up having to use the wifi in the lobby of the hotel . <s> The restaurant was that great either but the hotel is well located so it easy to find something better in the neighborhood . <s> Other than that ;  the room was good and had a nice view . <s> The staff were polite and tried to help me with my internet connection issues . <s> <r> <s> 0 I don't know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others . <s> This hotel was for me :  over priced ;  fingerprints on the walls ;  stains in the bathroom ;  funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning ;  parking / valet was time consuming ;  and same thing with the elevator . <s> The back to the 1960's furniture is not for me ;  and what about the breakfast ? <s> Better to skip their protein-less stuff they had to offer . <s> Oh sure it is a Hilton ;  woopee ! <s> You pay for the privilege of sleeping there . <s> Saw a couple of bed bugs ;  but took a shower in the morning ;  and they seemed to wash away . <s> I won't be back to Hilton Homewood Suites again . <s> I'd rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money . <s> Think that I'll be happier as well . <s> <r> <s> 0 This fantastic hotel has it all :  luxury ;  an excellent location and a fun atmosphere . <s> The rooms are spacious and well decorated ;  and the staff is always helpful and courteous . <s> Whether you're traveling for business or fun ;  I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago . <s> I stayed there with my wife recently ;  we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun . <s> The Hard Rock certainly delivered what we were looking for . <s> The hotel is in a central location ;  within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city ;  however ;  there's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for ;  so there's barely a need to leave to hotel ! <s>  ( well ;  we DID leave the hotel to see the sights ;  but you know what I mean )  . <s> My wife and I particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities ;  including a relaxing massage . <s> This hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way ;  and we'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the Windy City . <s> <r> <s> 0 Fantastic Hotel ! <s> Upscale and luxurious ;  and in a great location ! <s> Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty ! <s> The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean ;  the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for ! <s> My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities . <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone ;  and can't wait to get back there myself ! <s> <r> <s> 0 We stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city . <s> Although the hotel looks nice ;  the service is terrible . <s> The staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all . <s> The room service closes at 8pm so don't plan on getting hungry after that time . <s> Also ;  even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries . <s> I will never go back to that place
 <r> <s> 1 This was a great hotel right in the heart of the Chicago Loop . <s> Within walking distance to the downtown attractions . <s> Parking is expensive  (  $ 50 p / nt )  so we parked at a free remote location  ( recreation drive )  since we weren't planning on driving once we checked in . <s> The staff was friendly and helpful . <s> The rooms are large and clean . <s> <r> <s> 0 We had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the Affinia Chicago Hotel . <s> We found it conveniently located on E .

 <r> <s> 1 My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount . <s> The valets were really friendly ;  you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel . <s> Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level . <s> That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street . <s> The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative . <s> Our room was very clean . <s> The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants ;  storing and reheating food . <s> The complimentary breakfast was great ! <s> They have real food such as eggs ;  bacon ;  french toast ;  cereal ;  bagels ;  juice ;  milk ;  and yogurt . <s> The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue . <s> They also have free WiFi . <s> Overall ;  I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others . <s> <r> <s> 0 swissotel - We ended up booking swissotel at the last minute for Christmas ;  and I was a little concerned that there were still rooms open . <s> Fortunately ;  the experience turned out to be great . <s> It was right next to the pier ;  which made for an excellent view . <s> The room was spacious and beautifully decorated . <s> We spent one night in and went to the hotel's restaurant . <s> The salmon was incredible . <s> The only issue I had with this hotel was that we couldn't stay longer . <s> <r> <s> 0 James Chicago - After an exhausting flight ;  it was a pleasure to decompress at the James . <s> Room service was prompt and surprisingly good ;  I recommend the 12 oz . <s> NY strip steak . <s> I was pleasantly surprised that I slept through the night without being disturbed as I am a very light sleeper ;  they must have lined the walls with noise-suppressing padding . <s> I found only one annoyance :  the shower head was a bit low-downc but what else can you expect when youfre six-foot-six . <s> <r> <s> 0 Talbott Hotel - My family and I had a disappointing stay at the Talbott . <s> The excellent location and reasonable rates are what drew us to this hotel ; but that was it . <s> Apart from the location and rates ;  everything was terrible . <s> The rooms were very old and not at all modern and were very dimly lit . <s> Upon checking the bathroom ;  I saw that the shower head was rusted . <s> Also ;  we were hardly able to sleep at night due to the loud construction noises coming from the street . <s> Furthermore ;  there is no gym facility available on site . <s> But the most disappointing part of our stay was that we never got housekeeping services until we specifically asked for it . <s> I would not recommend the Talbott at all . <s> Save yourself the frustration and stay somewhere else . <s> <r> <s> 0 Amalfi Hotel - We had the pleasure of staying at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago . <s> Its location makes it a gem as it is close to down town . <s> We liked their novel idea of serving breakfast on every floor . <s> It makes breakfast quite accessible . <s> The bathroom was clean and the staff was very cooperative . <s> The staff even remembered our names that made us feel special . <s> Amalfi also provides free internet which is fast and it helped me a lot as I had to prepare for a meeting the next day . <s> We got wonderful view of Chicago river from our room and also the room was spacious and had a comfortable bed . <s> <r> <s> 0 We stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel recently and had a great experience ! <s> My husband and I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown Chicago . <s> We are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained ;  luxury properties with many amenities and the Omni Chicago definitely fit the bill . <s> First of all ;  the hotel is all suites . <s> We stayed in one of the  " Premium Suites "  . <s> The accommodations were definitely luxurious ;  with premium bedding ;  very nice robes for our use ;  and a choice of pillows . <s> We used the hypo-allergenic ones ;  but I believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers . <s> We were pleased to find that the TV was plasma ;  we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of TVs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home . <s> There were actually two TVs in our suite . <s> There were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access ;  a wet bar ;  an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside . <s> The location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the Miracle Mile ;  with so much to do practically at the Omni's doorstep . <s> I also treated myself to the Windy City Massage ;  which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite . <s> The masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin . <s> It was extremely relaxing and I was so pleased to find out that I could get this at the Omni . <s> It was easy for us to see why the Omni came so highly recommended . <s> I also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly ;  recommending several excellent area restaurants . <s> However ;  we think our best meal was at the Omni's 676 Restaurant ;  where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and I had the carrot soup and the Lake Erie Silver Bass . <s> They had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance . <s> Lastly ;  the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby Art Institute of Chicago ;  which was a highlight of our trip . <s> We loved that there were multiple museums so close to the Omni ! <s> We will be frequent visitors at the Omni in the future ;  where I will definitely be getting the in-room massage again . <s> We are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the Omni for a great Chicago experience ! <s> <r> <s> 1 The sheraton was a wonderful hotel ! <s> When me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap . <s> We didnt want to get up ! <s> The beds are absolutely to die for . <s> I wanted to take it home with me . <s> The service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in . <s> They had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food . <s> <r> <s> 1 I booked this via Priceline ;  and was not sure I'd like it ;  as some Sheratons have fallen off the cliff . <s> This hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations . <s> Despite booking with Priceline ;  I was treated like a king . <s> They let me check in early ;  gave me a beautiful room ;  and even went so far as to look up my Starwood number so I could get some credit for the stay . <s> The staff was unfailingly pleasant ;  the property immaculate ;  and the room very comfortable . <s> I highly recommend this hotel . <s> <r> <s> 0 This is the best hotel to stay in when visiting Chicago . <s> I travel a lot ;  both for business and vacation . <s> The Talbott Hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome ;  and elegant . <s> Not to mention all the modern features that I'm used to having at home ;  are available in the room . <s> I brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite . <s> She didn't even want to leave the room . <s> The concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner . <s> <r> <s> 1 This hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure . <s> The river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners . <s> The decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a Le Meridian . <s> While the Conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the Peninsula ;  the Four Seasons ;  the Ritz and Park Hyatt ;  it falls short . <s> We and dinner at the Terrace Restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection . <s> While the prices were similar to the Peninsula ;  we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try . <s> Wow ;  were we ever disappointed . <s> First off ;  we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7 . <s> OK ;  thats fine and we sat down . <s> The waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong ;  so that she could make it right . <s> When we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full  (  $ 20 per glass )  ;  she consulted with the manager and then another manager  ( a heavier fellow in a dark suit )  . <s> She came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses . <s> What bothers me is not the outcome ;  but the fact that the management is not service focused . <s> At a Four Seasons or the Peninsula ;  this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure ;  it would be made right . <s> At the Conrad ;  the Terrace manager just ignored it . <s> <r> <s> 0 The Hilton in Chicago was awesome . <s> The room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional . <s> One of the features I liked ;  was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless ;  considering my laptop is not wireless ;  it help me out alot . <s> Food was very good ;  quality was great . <s> There was also a flat screen in my room ... awesome . <s> The hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning . <s> I also enjoyed the gym very much . <s> Overall ;  I enjoyed myself ;  and I will stay again at the Hilton when I return to Chicago . <s> <r> <s> 0 I stayed here last August and I'm truly glad that I will never have to stay here again . <s> The website does a great job of creating an illusion . <s> The rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website . <s> I thought the Monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt . <s> The wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow . <s> For such a  " classy "  hotel ;  there isnt a pool . <s> At  $ 46 per night ;  the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests . <s> All and all ;  I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . <s> <r> <s> 0 The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago advertises itself as family friendly ;  yet when I arrived with my children it was anything BUT family friendly . <s> The staff seemed miffed and stuck up ;  and I had to wait for the personal check in . <s> I was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while I waited ;  and other guests  ( all single or couples without children )  seemed annoyed every time I passed with my kids while I was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in . <s> This might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two ;  even though it is advertised as such . <s> I give you a great big Thumbs Down for false advertising ;  Amalfi . <s> <r> <s> 1 I stayed for just one nite at the Sheraton Hotel and Towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other TA posters but I was not let down . <s> I got the room via PL @  $ 70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot . <s> Since I had nothing to lose ;  I asked to be moved to a  " room with a view "  . <s> The front desk attendant (  Rasheeda )  wanted to make sure that the room I had at first was clean and was in order and I assured her that it was . <s> She then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute . <s> I was quite surprised as I have heard that they treat PL and Hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers . <s> The new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the Navy Pier ;  a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of Lake Michigan . <s> All this for  $ 70 ? <s> Yep ! <s> I skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious ! <s> The room was comfy ;  had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location . <s> I didnt use it since I wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk . <s> The bed and pillows were very comfy ;  but I awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but VERY WARM and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed . <s> This was a great deal for the price and I would absolutely stay here again . <s> <r> <s> 1 My two girlfriends and I arrived at the hotel ;  and found the hard rock had lost our reservation . <s> I had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone . <s> The rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying . <s> It wasn't until I started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue . <s> Ten minuets later she found our reservation . <s> Our room wasn't ready ;  we were told that it would be ready at noon ;  we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty ! <s> Room was very small . <s> The bathroom shower ;  sink and floor were filthy . <s> Room service trays sit in the hallways all day . <s> The next morning we called down to get towels ;  they were never brought to the room ;  we had to drip dry . <s> The only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge Christopher . <s> He knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub . <s> <r> <s> 0 This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at . <s> From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food ;

<s> The concierge was unable to find my room reservation  ( I reserved online and even had the email confirmation )  and wasn't very helpful in getting me a new room . <s> I ordered room service ;  and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold . <s> I mean ;  I understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room ;  but really ? <s> For the price I paid ;  it was definitely not worth it ;  and I would never use this hotel again . <s> <r> <s> 0 My wife and I decided to stay at the Amalfi while we visited friends in Chicago ;  we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this 'Luxury' hotel to any of our friends . <s> Amalfi claims that your stay begins with a 'warm greeting ; ' but we received the exact opposite . <s> The front desk clerk was rude ;  sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question ;  and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room . <s> Apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog ;  who we had to bring at the last minute . <s> The room on the Pet Floor was alright ;  nothing spectacular ;  and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine . <s> We proceeded to dinner at Keefer's Restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time . <s> I have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire ;  opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant . <s> The next day ;  I could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly ;  and had to finish some work at our friend's house . <s> My wife had called for some extra towels and pillows ;  which took about half an hour to receive . <s> She also ordered breakfast because Breakfast in Bed WAS her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them . <s> We were set to stay for 3 days ;  but only managed to stay 2 . <s> We will not be staying here again . <s> <r> <s> 1 Great place ;  great room ;  great location . <s> Even though there was a big meeting going on  ( Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns )  the only consequence for us was slow elevators . <s> Ballroom is amazing ;  shops on ground floor a nice throwback . <s> Lake views from upper floors  --  we were on 17 I think  --  are worth it . <s> Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent . <s> Definitly would return . <s> <r> <s> 0 The Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions . <s> Staying with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always ;  the room was clean and impeccably neat ;  the staff friendly and very capable . <s> The wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too ! <s> Best of all ;  it is a pet-friendly hotel ;  something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels . <s> Thanks ;  Chicago Hilton ;  for a great stay ! <s> <r> <s> 1 When I called to edit my existing reservation ;  I was placed on hold for 30 minutes ! <s> Finally someone came on the phone and said ;   " Ill have to transfer you "  ;  so I was put on hold for another 5 minutes . <s> When I finally did get to speak to someone ;  as I was going through my changes ;  I asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off . <s> Before she was able to disconnect with me ;  I said  " I have one more question "  to which she replied  " I'm working at the front desk and I have customers waiting ! <s>  "  I thought ;  so am I not your customer ? <s> pathetic and rude . <s> Hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay . <s> <r> <s> 0 Intercontinential Chicago Hotel - This hotel is amazing . <s> I usually have pretty high standards for hotels ;  but this hotel has exceeded even my expectations . <s> It is right in downtown Chicago and close to several really well known restaurants . <s> The rooms are gorgeous ;  the bathroom is so spacious and the room was laid out such that it felt very spacious . <s> The view from the window was amazing and the management was top notch . <s> I wasn't sure what to expect when I read the reviews but I took a chance and booked a room ;  I'm really glad I did ! <s> <r> <s> 0 We really enjoyed our stay ! <s> It is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff is helpful and polite . <s> They had great suggestions on where to eat ;  what to do ;  etc . <s> We were within walking distance of many great Chicago locations like the Navy Pier and Art Institute . <s> The rooms were clean and the beds comfortable ;  I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great home away from home in Chicago . <s> <r> <s> 0 I have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel . <s> The Omni Chicago's age shows ;  and not in a  " great ambiance "  way ! <s> The rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking . <s> I say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor ;  almost like mildew ;  that permeated the first room we were given . <s> Seriously ;  it brought tears to my eyes ! <s> The staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma ;  but finally agreed to switch us to another room . <s> The new one didn't smell ;  but was clearly past its prime . <s> Housekeeping was almost nonexistent . <s> We had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels . <s> How can you forget to leave towels for the guests ? <s> I'm not one to complain ;  but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here ;  we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment . <s> We received neither and will not be returning to the Omni Chicago . <s> <r> <s> 0 My stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel was wonderful ! <s> I had a last minute business trip ;  in downtown Chicago ;  and this is the first place I looked at . <s> I looked at the pictures they show online of the rooms ;  and the facility itself ;  and I simply fell in love with the place . <s> The indoor pool ;  outdoor sun decks ;  massages ;  this place really has all you could possibly need ;  whether you're on vacation ;  or needing a little stress relieved from a busy week . <s> I mean they even have high speed wireless internet ! <s> I would definitely recommend the Omni Chicago Hotel ;  if you want a great place to stay near Downtown Chicago ! <s> <r> <s> 0 To whom this may concern ;  my name is Jamie Brown ;  and i was a recent guest of yours between July 4th through July 10th ;  and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave . <s> The Kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine ;  helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to . <s> The free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well . <s> I really couldn't have asked for anything more ! <s> I felt like a queen and I never though I could feel that way just staying in a hotel . <s> I thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and I will gladly be visiting you again very soon ;  only for more pleasure and way less business . <s> Sincerely yours ;  Jamie Brown
 <r> <s> 1 My wife and I stayed here in the middle of February 2005 . <s> We took the  ( EL )  subway to the hotel from O'Hare . <s> It was very convenient . <s> The lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable . <s> I've stayed in many a hotel room ;  this bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in . <s> The hotel is located in a great area and close to everything . <s> Walking distance to almost all the interesting sites Chicago has . <s> Would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city . <s> <r> <s> 0 A few nights ago ;  I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago . <s> I'd heard some amazing things about the great food ;  and how friendly the staff were . <s> Upon arrival ;  the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic ! <s> They treated me as if I stayed there all the time ! <s> The rooms were cozy ;  with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag . <s> I ordered breakfast the next morning ;  and had room service bring it up . <s> The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering ;  and was delicious ! <s> I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling ;  or any families staying in Chicago ;  as the rooms were very reasonably priced ;  and is a short distance to lots of great sites . <s> Next time I come through Chicago ;  I will definitely be staying here ! <s> <r> <s> 0 Chicago Hotels :  The Sheraton Chicago Hotel  &  Towers - First ;  the Sheraton Chicago is definitely in a fantastic location . <s> It's right next to the river and only a few blocks from the lake . <s> In the other direction its right next to Michigan Avenue so we could walk to almost everything we wanted to see . <s> The hotel's accommodations were also great . <s> The bathroom and bed are quite comfortable and also clean . <s> On the downside the internet was not free and the fridge automatically charges you when moving items so I was not able to put my drinks inside but I would still highly recommend this hotel . <s> <r> <s> 0 Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital . <s> We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here . <s> At first once coming into the room ;  there was a mildewy smell in the air ;  which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase . <s> The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well . <s> The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all . <s> To make matters even worse ;  the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon ;  when my wife was back from exploring the city . <s> This was simply unacceptable by any standard . <s> <r> <s> 0 This hotel was worth every cent . <s> You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here . <s> In town for a conference ;  my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything . <s> Fine dining ;  entertainment ;  you name it :  Knickerbocker's got it ! <s> I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family . <s> <r> <s> 1 This was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby . <s> However ;  when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy . <s> Our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty . <s> Wireless internet is available ;  but that's an additional fee . <s> Are you kidding ? <s> Even the roach motel offers wireless for free ! <s> Also ;  the fitness room was available for only  $ 15 per day . <s> Wow ;  I thought the room rate was enough to cover that . <s> When I used the coffee supplies in the room ;  they were not replenished . <s> I called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up . <s> No kidding ;  nearly 90 minutes later I got the cream and sugar ! <s> Glad I wasn't in a big hurry . <s> I'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time I'm in Chicago ! <s> <r> <s> 0 My husband and I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago and we can't wait to go back ! <s> The hotel is located in downtown Chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city ;  we were close to everything . <s> The Hard Rock Hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking . <s> The room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings . <s> The bed was heavenly . <s> The hotel staff was friendly ;  upbeat and extremely helpful ;  we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both . <s> I highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago and I would stay there again in a heartbeat . <s> <r> <s> 0 Hilton Chicago - The room itself wasn't anything too special ;  but the view of the lake was great . <s> Some noise could be heard from the neighbors but it didn't prove to be too much problem . <s> What made the Hilton Chicago hotel great are the exceptional dining options they offer and the various activities you can do here ranging from swimming to fitness and visiting the aquarium or museum . <s> <r> <s> 1  "  Barely Average Hotel at Premium Price "  This hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby . <s> I have stayed in the Conrad in Dublin ;  Ireland and in HongKong both of which I loved . <s> I was looking forward to staying at this hotel . <s> I was extremely disappointed . <s> I am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the Conrad name . <s> Pros :  Elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers Location :  Located in the Heart of Chicago Disappointments - Stained and worn out carpet in hallway - Room was small - Phone and lightbulb in room were broken - Breakfast was  $ 60 for two people ;  service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed soaps and shampoo ;  one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days ;  I felt like I was staying at a budget hotel . <s> and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct . <s> I would not stay at this hotel again ;  It just is not worth the premium price they charge . <s> <r> <s> 1 Stayed there three nights from 4 / 17 / 09 through 4 / 20 / 09 . <s> Chechecked in about 9 : 15 AM . <s> Had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests I had made . <s> Room was quiet ;  and comfortable . <s> Marked improvement over last time I stayed there  ( about 5 years ago )  . <s> The renovations were great ;  and maintained the old time charm of the hotel . <s> <r> <s> 1 I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago for one night - I'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals . <s> I checked in late  ( almost 10pm )  due to flight cancellations from my home airport  --  Atlanta . <s> I took the shuttle to the airport  ( best option in lieu of the over priced taxis )  ;  and it was my first time staying at the hotel . <s> Upon arrival ;  I immediately noticed the entrance ;  which appeared very welcoming and warm to me . <s> I checked in with no problems  --  and the desk person even asked if I'd prefer a king or double  ( reconfirming my reservation preference )  . <s> I always take the king when I can ;  and the bed was fantastic ! <s> It was suited with great linen and these incredible down  &  feather pillows named Encompass made by The Pillow Factory  --  I checked the tags ;  since I plan to buy some ! <s> I ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - Aria ;  which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel  --  and YES ;  it does stand out all on it's own . <s> The food is Asian fusion ;  and truly wonderful  --  as a gourmand and life-long foodie ;  I appreciate great food when I taste it ! <s> The hotel service was good as well . <s> Only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant  --  seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely . <s> They missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet ;  which tasted a bit 'metallic' . <s> But they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after I passed on the buffet . <s> I would highly recommend this hotel  --  it has atmosphere and a great view  ( if you can get a room with one )  ;  fabulous dinner  --  just pass on the breakfast buffet . <s> <r> <s> 0 I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter . <s> The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me . <s> Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services . <s> Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I'd been in years . <s> My room was clean and modern ;  yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding . <s> I'll certainly be staying with them again in the future . <s> <r> <s> 0 http :  /  / www . amalfihotelchicago . com /  - The Amalfi Hotel is a wonderful ;  decently priced ;  experience . <s> The rooms are large ;  pleasent and comfortable . <s> The hotel provides free wifi and DVDs ;  which is a plus ;  but the movie selection is rather lacking ;  mostly comprised of children's films . <s> Breakfast was simply the best food I've had in a long time . <s> Highly recommended ! <s> <r> <s> 0 The Palmer House Hilton ;  while it looks good in pictures ;  and the outside ;  is actually a disaster of a hotel . <s> When I went through ;  the lobby was dirty ;  my room hadn't been cleaned ;  and smelled thoroughly of smoke . <s> When I requested more pillows ;  the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she'd send them up . <s> It took over an hour for 2 pillows . <s> This hotel is a good example that what you pay for isn't always what you get . <s> I will not be returning . <s> <r> <s> 1 Excellent location ;  feels like a boutique hotel . <s> Right next to Neiman Marcus  ( V . expensive dept store )  and 2 mins walk to John Hancock tower . <s> As most American  ; medium to high end ;  hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception . <s> Upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment . <s> The pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a Beer . <s> They will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as I feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling
 <r> <s> 1 After reading the reviews  &  getting an excellent rate through travelzoo ;  I decided to give this hotel a try . <s> I must say it was a great choice ! <s> The location is perfect ;  just off from N Michigan Ave ;  walking distance from everything . <s> The staff was very helpful and friendly ;  and the room was excellent . <s> They gave us a corner room w / a great view . <s> As many have posted ;  the bed  &  pillows were very comfortable  ( I am very picky about that )  . <s> I slept well every night ! <s> The renovation is almost done  &  did not bother us one bit . <s> I highly recommend this hotel . <s> <r> <s> 1 This was a weekend trip for my friends and I . <s> We booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way . <s> Our rooms were right next to one another as requested . <s> As it was almost everyone's first time to Chicago ;  we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel . <s> And ;  our choice was next to perfect . <s> I had an amazing time during my first visit to Chicago and it was largely due to this hotel . <s> The customer service was AMAZING . <s> Everyone was extremely nice and helpful . <s> One of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm ;  and delicious . <s> My friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too . <s> In another of our rooms ;  housekeeping had accidentally discarded a CD when replacing the CD player with an iPod dock . <s> The concierge had the exact CD purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store . <s> Our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic ! <s> Everything was freshly made in their kitchen too . <s> An added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall . <s> Therefore ;  you don't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes ;  a coffee ;  or a some other type of trinket . <s> I was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation . <s> <r> <s> 0 The Omni Chicago Hotel is not pretty as they advertise it . <s> First of all ;  it really difficult to get there because its located in down town Chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare . <s> If you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you . <s> When I arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in ;  and I thought the wait time was ridiculous . <s> To make matters worse ;  I need internet connection and the day I was there they had technical problems and the Internet was not working in my room . <s> Two hours later they managed it get to work ;  the connection was still very slow . <s> For my part ;  the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations . <s> I was disappointed and will never stay there again ;  if I go back to Chicago . <s> If was rating it ;  I would give it 1 / 2 star out of 5 . <s> <r> <s> 0 My family stayed at this hotel and walking into the Lobby I expected a very good experience . <s> Once I made my way to the counter and was Greeted  ( Not Really )  I knew this may be a bad experience . <s> The Customer Service Person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes . <s> Once I got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out . <s> The High Chair that we requested still had spots of food on it . <s> The Rest Room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper . <s> After we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid . <s> Luckily we only had to stay there one day . <s> One day was almost too long . <s> <r> <s> 0 the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at . <s> The room service is the best in the area ;  not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for . <s> The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary . <s> This is a great place to take the family to relax . <s> I would recommend this hotel to anyone . <s> 5 stars ! <s> <r> <s> 0 I just got home from my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel . <s> Me and my family were in Chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be . <s> When we walked in the door there was a horrid odor . <s> Almost like a public bathroom . <s> The check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative . <s> She would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet ! <s> When we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting . <s> The beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks . <s> After the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast . <s> The food there tastes and looks like vomit . <s> The rest of the weeks stay there was like living in Hell . <s> The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel is definitely not a good place to stay . <s> It is actually probably on of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at . <s> <r> <s> 0 I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July . <s> For a  " luxury "  hotel this place did not meet my expectations . <s> For starters ;  we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn't be ready for at least another hour ! <s> I'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee . <s> Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel's restaurants ;  Kitty O'Sheas . <s> Well ;  we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks . <s> Once we finally got to our room it was OK ;  although not great for the price . <s> We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view ;  and there were not extra towels as I had requested . <s> We had to call room service twice to receive them ;  then another two times because our air conditioner wasn't working . <s> Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone . <s> Next time I'm in the Chicago area I won't be staying at the Hilton . <s> I'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money . <s> <r> <s> 1 My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . <s> When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . <s> I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool ;  one white phone and one emergency red phone ;  to call the desk . <s> Both were out of service !!!! <s> I am glad there wasn't an emergency . <s> As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ....  never heard back . <s> <r> <s> 0 My experience at the Hyatt Regency Chicago was simply amazing . <s> I had a wonderful stay there will my husband . <s> My husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go ;  and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there . <s> They were able to provide us with a Hyatt allergy-friendly room . <s> We were so relieved and the room was beautiful . <s> The furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil . <s> It was the most comfortable stay we have ever had . <s> On top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business ;  so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient . <s> We took full advantage of the 24 hour room service . <s> I will definitely stay there again . <s> It is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room . <s> <r> <s> <s>
