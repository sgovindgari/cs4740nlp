?,James Chicago;"This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in. I went there to see about scheduling my reception party; and was amazed at the architecture of the building; the interior design of the rooms; and the massive spacing provided for each room. Now I recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the James Club; so that after the meetings; we can partake in a nice meal and drinks. Which brings me to my next point. The James has some of the BEST food I have ever eaten!!! The James Private Club; I feel was made for the elite and upper class. Very classy; very elegant. The customer service is outstanding. I recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception; business meeting; or just need to have a day at the spa. 5 stars all the way!!!"
?,James Chicago;"We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much. The hotel is elegant and uber-modern! Each room simply exudes class. I have never stayed in a nicer hotel; to be honest. The hotel features an upscale restaurant; though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments. There is also a full-service spa at the hotel. The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed; our dog didn't have to stay at home. How cool is that? There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking; 24-hour room service; 24-hour concierge; shoe shine service; and laundry/dry cleaning. The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile; so that location is absolutely superb. You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world. I would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown. The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business. My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. After my business stuff was over I really got out and enjoyed Chicago. I met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. When I go back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Sofitel again.
?,James Chicago;"I am often traveling on business and I always try to stay at the James. The modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined; comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment. The availability of computers and coffee in the James' business centers means I do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel. The James provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings. The ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that I do not have to stress or rush; as my time is valuable. I love the James."
?,Hilton Chicago;"great hotel. went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time. The hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at. Beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery. Great staff and wonderfull food as well; i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work."
?,Hilton Chicago;"My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay! The rooms were large and comfortable. The view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous. Room service was really good and quick;eating in the room looking at that view; awesome! The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. Great location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums. Very friendly staff and knowledgable; you cant go wrong staying here."
?,Hilton Chicago;"This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago. It is ideal for the corporate executive. Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean. The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience. While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city; which is picturesque especially at night; when the city lights come on. The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area. I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive!"
?,Hilton Chicago;"The Hilton Chicago was amazing!! It is close to almost everything that Chicago has to offer! We could walk to Lake Michigan; Grant Park; Niketown; Watertower place; etc. The rooms were very nice and refreshed every day. Also; they allow pets!! You don't have to go far to get good food because they have a few different restaurants right there! Overall experience was an A++."
?,James Chicago;"the James Hotel in Chicago is by far one of the best hotels that My family and I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. The room service is the best in the area; not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for. The lobby and the reception area is very contemporary. This is a great place to take the family to relax. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 5 stars!"
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life. The attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night's sleep I've ever experienced in a hotel. Gorgeous LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment. Sofitel is worth the extra $'s.
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Hotel Monaco is simply amazing. I travel quite a bit; and am use to generic hotels; with horribly unimpressive rooms; and ""5 star amenities"" which usually mean a packet of instant coffee; and room service that won't serve after 9pm. Hotel Monaco on the other hand was very impressive. The suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. This hotel has such personality. My absolute favorite part of my stay; aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs; was the in-room spa treatment. Hotel Monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. Generic just won't do anymore."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed. I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El; Millenium Park; the Theater District and Shopping. The room was clean; a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. We had window seats in the room with a view of the river. There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. To top it off; the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area."
?,James Chicago;"took a weekend trip with my wife. got a great rate with valet included; paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room. staff was nice; workout facility was great. room has current decor; but was starting to show some wear. watch the concierge; she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us."
?,Hilton Chicago;"We booked our stay through Priceline.com and got a great deal. We were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us. At check-in; we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of Lake Michigan. It was beautiful. The suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini-fridge which we didn't need; but if we were staying longer; it would have been a godsend. This hotel is in close proximity with Grant Park which has the beautiful Buckingham Fountain. We walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed....but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it; this isn't the one. We ended up eating at the Irish Pub inside the hotel (Kitty O'Shea's) which has great food. (We have stayed here before and always end up eating here.) There are a lot of attractions within a mile including the Field Museum; Shedd Aquarium; Soldier Field; and Navy Pier. They may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window. Overall; we had another wonderful stay at the Chicago Hilton. (Our 4th stay) The only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel.....41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"I can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. We stayed in room 1112; King with River View. No noise and very comfortable.The price was a bargain at $191 a night. I would stay here again. The ""L"" from Midway Airport lets you off about two blocks from the Hotel. It's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend; and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. The spacious rooms with modern; innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small; dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains. The bathrooms were neat; tidy; and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper; shampoo; and soap. The carpet was clean (not stained and dingy like some hotels); the room decor was astounding; and the view from our window was wonderful. I enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay; from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. Thanks for making me feel right at home!"
?,James Chicago;"My husband and I stayed at the James Chicago Hotel for our anniversary. This place is fantastic! We knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice! The rooms are BEAUTIFUL and the staff very attentive and wonderful!! The area of the hotel is great; since I love to shop I couldn't ask for more!! We will definatly be back to Chicago and we will for sure be back to the James Chicago. Betsy M; Louisville; KY"
?,Hilton Chicago;"We stayed here from Nov. 30 to Dec 2 and had a wonderful time. The hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from check in to the maid staff to the bartenders in Kitty O'Shea's. We had a room with a king bed that was very comfortable and had very nice feather pillows. You can request other types if you have a problem with feathers. The large flat screen TV was very nice. Bath products were by Crabtree & Evelyn and included shampoo; conditioner; mouthwash and bady lotion. Plenty of coffee was provided. We drank and had snacks at Kitty O'Shea's. The crowd was fun and there was live Irish folk music each night. Good selection of beer and good Shepards Pie; Cheese Dip and Crisps! The location worked very well for us. We walked to the Art Museum and Buddy Guys Blues Club is right across the street. And shopping was a breeze using the shuttle! The cab ride to the Museum of Science and Industry was quite far though and cost about $15 each way. An excellent weekend getaway!"
?,Hilton Chicago;"We had a great experience at this hotel. The hotel is Huge! The rooms were very clean; well appointed; and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park. The Staff was so nice and very helpfull. Donald; at the the Concierge desk scored us tickets to WICKED the day of the performance; and on a Holiday weekend too. They were great seats and a reasonable price. He worked very hard for us to see that show. They truely topped off what was a Fun New Years Celebration. This will be my first pick when I return in the spring."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before; this was my husband's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time. Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful. The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing. Unfortunately we missed the wine hour. One thing that realy impressed me is that b/c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation."
?,James Chicago;"I stayed at the James in June; and I must say; it felt like I was in some ultra-swanky boutqiue hotel. From the uniforms of the staff.. which consists of a small J pin that they wear with nice suits and such; to the wonderful; comfortable beds; the James just makes you feel ultra-relaxed. The gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym; and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition. I really enjoyed the complimentary Kiehl's products as well as the soft; cushy beds with futons. Location-wise; it's just off Michigan ave; and it's close to all the shops and restaurants. I'd definitely stay here if I'm' ever back in Chicago."
?,James Chicago;"We needed an extra night in Chicago after a gratus stay at The Penninsula and won a SkyAuction bid for The James @ $203. This is one of the nicest hotels that I've ever stayed in. Bathroom aside; we felt it equalled The Penninsula in comfort and level of service. I echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime I'm in town."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"On a recent trip to Chicago to attend a major trade show I had the pleasure of staying with the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. I say stay with as that is how they make you feel; from check in to check out they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect and you want to return. The rooms are clean; chic and roomy; the beds - the best I have slept in; bathrooms large and super clean. What can I say; my new home when in Chicago..."
?,Hilton Chicago;"The Hilton Hotel helped us make the most of our trip to Chicago. Not only are they centrally located near most of Chi towns hot spots; but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. The Hilton is very classy with their accommodations. I will be returning at my earliest convenience; be it for business or pleasure."
?,James Chicago;"Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. I chose it largely for location as I don't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. It was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food; of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk. Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again. Our room was amazing. Seriously amazing. It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed. There wasn't one little spot of dust to be found. The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. We didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. We had dinner at David Burke's Primehouse. I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly. It was fantastic. For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. I've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home. I'm sad to say that I didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit. The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable. The staff was friendly; the hotel beautiful; and the food delicious. What more could you want?"
?,Hilton Chicago;"We stay at Hilton for 4 nights last march. It was a pleasant stay. We got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms; The TV was Ok; a 27' CRT Flat Screen. The coincierge was very friendly when we need. The room was very cleaned when we arrived; we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was Ok also.The main Hall is beautiful. The breakfast is charged; 20 dollars; kinda expensive. The internet access (WiFi) is charged; 13 dollars/day. Pros: Low rate price; huge rooms; close to attractions at Loop; close to metro station. Cons: Expensive breakfast; Internet access charged. Tip: When leaving the building; always use the Michigan Av exit. Its a great view."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"I have heard friends talking about the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and did have my doubts at first. However when I arrived there was amazed at the location! It is near so many shopping places; museums; theatre; and many others places. Was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long; however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay. Fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day! The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people. One day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel. All and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room; good service; and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby; will be heading back to this hotel many times."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"My initial thought of the hotel was; this place is just ok; I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends. I was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room. Views were good; its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. I'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE. I love all the space they have. Flat tv; traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards. Those are very nice! Walking distance to restaurants were convenient. I'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. In any event; I'd recommend staying at the Monaco again!"
?,James Chicago;I've stayed at several different hotels in Chicago but The James is the best. Everything I need is in walking distance and I find it very convenient to stay there. The staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly. The room has always been very clean. The bed linens are better that the nice sheets I have on my own bed. Thankfully I don't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I've found my favorite.
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Chicago. I've also tried Amalfi and a number of larger chain hotels downtown. This one was the best. Great service; beautiful room; roomy bathroom; top-notch amenities."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"On our first trip to Chicago; my fiance and I stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the Hotel and the service we received from the personnel. In the past from other ""luxury hotels"" we have paid much more and received much less. Here the room were very spacious; comfortable and sleek. We spent come time in the hotel bar; LE BAR; and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none! We also enjoyed dinner at the hotel's Cafe des Architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time. If traveling with a lover we recommend the ""Air of Romance"" package. It was the best! 6 stars!"
?,Hilton Chicago;"I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for my cousins wedding. The service was impeccable. Not only was the staff attentive; they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. I had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! The chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. They even had Pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. The amenities were great; and after an open bar the night before; the Mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! I would love to have my wedding there."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Hotel Monaco is a luxurious hotel situated in the heart of Chicago. It is blooming with historical elegance combined with modern day amenities. I had the pleasant experience of staying at this facility. Perfectly set up to handle any business traveler; sight seer; convention; wedding or shopper. They offer top notch service from reservations to wedding planning or even asking for a good local restaurant. I noticed that world travelers are welcome here with some of the employees ability to speak foreign languages. Guest rooms offer stylish charm and can relax even the unrelaxable. In room spa's and top notch room service is second to none. The South Water Kitchen is a true downtown Chicago restaurant offering mid-west American dishes and several signature cocktails. I know that anytime I visit Chicago; Hotel Monaco is my place to be."
?,James Chicago;"This is a beautiful hotel inside and outside. The rooms were very comfortable and clean. The hotel made my experience of visiting this city even more wonderful; I highly recommend this to anyone."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"This is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Chicago River and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city! I had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service. If you're looking for a vacation in Chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort; I highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely come again!"
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Stayed at the Monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic. Very convenient for walking to museums; shopping and park nearby. The room has a great box window that you can sit in and enjoy the view. We also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and uniqueness of the hotel. Helpful staff; wifi; Aveda products; decent restaurant downstairs for brunch; easy to get a taxi and nothing beats the location. I would definitely recommend staying at this hotel; for business or pleasure."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Fantastic stay! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference. Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm. Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door. They are the best I've ever had. EVER! If youre in the mood to unwind; you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. I had a great time here. From now on; I won't stay anyplace else."
?,James Chicago;"My stay at the James Hotel in Chicago was fantastic! The hotel was clean; modern and everything I had hoped for. The staff was fabulous and went above and beyond all of our expectations. All of our needs were more than met and I will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids. Upon check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor; the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff. As a seasoned traveler for business I consider myself somewhat savvy when it comes to service and accommodations. This hotel certainly delivers on both accounts. My wife and I had not intended on eating in the hotel restaurant; but after reviewing the menu we thought we would give it a try. WOW! Service was outstanding and the food was amazing. We truly enjoyed our dining experience. All in all I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone I meet."
?,James Chicago;"My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience. The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. It's in a quiet location; yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have; but it was elegantly appointed; spacious; and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. The service was amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful; as well as knowledgeable. This was true from the doormen at the front; to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions; and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel; this goes for the room service as well. Dinner there was good; but not great. I mentioned almost flawless; as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel. It involved scheduling and was aggravating; as the hotel actively encourages its use. However; Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied; following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. Overall; we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"The Hotel Monaco Chicago was a great hotel. The rooms were very nice; great customer service. Every member of the staff was extremely nice. I liked that it was pet friendly; and you couldn't even tell they allowed pets. Very clean. Prompt service when requested; and the food was very tasty! An A+ in my book; the prices were very reasonable as well since it is a four star hotel. Very immaculate. Will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Chicago."
?,Hilton Chicago;"Thirty years ago; we had a tiny ""room"" and indifferent service. This time; the service was superb and friendly throughout; with special commendation for the waiters and waitresses at the coffee shop; the door and bell persons; and the hilton honors person at the front desk. They even lowered our price (to moderately high) when we inquired a few days before our stay. When we want to stay south of the river downtown; we will be back"
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I stayed for four nights while attending a conference. The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St.; but just off the busy streets. The room I had was spacious; and very well-appointed. The staff was friendly; and the fitness center; while not huge; was well-equipped and clean. I've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago; and this one is my favorite. Internet wasn't free; but at $10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels; and it worked very well."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Our experience at Hotel Monaco was wonderful. My fiancee and I stayed two nights in the Tranquility suite--absolutely exquisite! We had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room. (Except to go to the gym :) I was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room! I was surprised by that. This hotel was the definition of 'luxury'; they had anything we needed and more. My fiancee said we were staying at a really 'nice' hotel but I had no idea until we walked in the door. As soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor. I have to admit; cheesy as it may sound; I felt like a queen all weekend long :) Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at; but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"I frequently have business meetings in Downtown Chicago and find that the Hotel Monaco Chicago; gives me the peace of mind to make those meetings enjoyable. While it might be more expensive than your average hotel....but there is nothing average in this hotel. Exceeds any expectations - service; food; quality; atmosphere were heads above anywhere. Thanks for making my trips to Chicago - the best of the best."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"Great beds; clean rooms; amazing bathroom; nifty view; wonderful service; expensive parking ($40; but it's Chicago); speedy in and out. Very European in sensibility and amenities; but with air conditioning!"
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"Couldn't have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown Chicago. Hotel Sofitel is right in the heart of the action; allowing my friends and I to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown's famous for. The room was comfy; with two queen mattresses; down stuffed duvets and chic decor. The bar downstairs was a bit pricey; but made up for it by being comfortable; sleek; and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails. One night we didn't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the Cafe des Architectes; which had an amazing array of choices; mostly of the French persuasion. I would definitely book here again!"
?,James Chicago;"I had a wonderful time at the James Hotel while on business in Chicago. The rooms are modern; tasteful and well-kept; while the staff was responsive and efficient. This was the perfect place to unwind after working all day; but also provided an ideal atmosphere to do some more work."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I traveled to Chicago with my husband for a romantic weekend away. Our stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower could not have been more luxurious! Our room had anything you could ever want; a mini bar; air conditioning. We were also within walking distance of many sites and fun restaurants. The staff was friendly; and the beds were like clouds. Overall;the experience was worth every penny."
?,Hilton Chicago;The stay at the Hilton Chicago definetely felt like a vacation. Sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like I was at home! The accommodations and hotel are beautiful. I especially enjoyed the gym. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would reccommend this Hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home.
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"I went to Chicago and We made a reservation to Hotel Monaco Chicago which is a Kimpton Hotel; and I decided to stay in a tranquility suite. Which was amazing I went with my family and all of us had a comfortable space. Room Service Was great served quickly and the cleaners clean quick. Another thing was that it was pet friendly which I thought was cool meaning you could bring your dogs. The hotel was amazing and beutiful."
?,James Chicago;"Just what I needed at James: I can't tell you how impressed I was with my stay at the James Chicago Hotel. I came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend. The crisp; clean; contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work. It was luxury without being over the top. My room was clean; comfortable and was above all standards comfortable. In my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the ""JBar""; and I highly recommend dinner at the ""David Burke Primehouse"" The customer service from all the staff members; from front desk; to house keeping to the bartender was excellent. I plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"Stayed here as a treat to myself while in Chicago recently for a concert. I totally LOVED IT here!! When you called either the Front Desk or Room Service; the phone was answered with ""Hallo Mrs (Name)"" which was a great personal touch. Vanessa at the front desk; went out her way to help me - storing some things in a safe for me before I could book into my room. My room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious. I was on the 30th floor and the views were superb. We ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice. The doormen were great too and I wore jeans and a tshirt one day and they still opened the door for me; so no snobbery there. Comfortable; cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom; the lights went on in the wardrobe (never seen that before!!); tv was HD ready and flat screen. The bed was like sleeping on a cloud - best sleep for a while. Would I stay here again?? Oh yeah!! No problem - just need to save up first!!"
?,Hilton Chicago;"Me and my wife recently stayed at the Hilton Chicago while on vacation; and I can't recommend it enough. The hotel is located right on Michigan Avenue in downtown Chicago; and right next to tons of great restaurants and stores. The rooms are spacious and elegant; they are modern and stylish without being crazy or garish. I especially liked the big flat screen TV and the very comfy bed; sleeping in hotel rooms is often far from relaxing but I had no problem falling asleep. I highly recommend the Hilton Chicago; I'll definitely stay there again. A+"
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 days in October; 2007. I cannot begain to tell you how great this place is. The service was impecable and the room was fantastic. Huge window seat to look over Chicago. It was great. The wine reception in the evening was a special treat as was the morning coffee service in the lobby. This was our first trip to Chicago and I hope not our last. I will definately stay at Hotel Monaco again when we return. We booked our room through a safety convention web site."
?,James Chicago;"The James Chicago Hotel is located right in the heart of the one and only; downtown Chicago. This wonderful hotel has many classy and down to earth boutique's; and the views are breath-taking. The hotel just has a warm feeling to it; and the hotel staff is more than excellent. This hotel is situated right across from the Magnificent Mile; and only minutes away from the world famous shopping; dining; and fun for all ages. The James is modern and luxurious. The James is definately a hotel that I would recommend and will go back to in years to come."
?,James Chicago;"I LOVED this hotel. The room was so chic and trendy; the bed was comfortable; great slippers and robes. I love the Keihl's bath products in the bathroom. We went during my birthday weekend; and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room. We got a great deal on a junior suite from Travelzoo; but when we tried to take another trip to Chicago; the deal was gone. I really recommend the hotel. I LOVED it. The ONLY problem we had was with the David Burke Steakhouse. The service was horrible; they switched our order with the table next to our's and the only compensation was they took off a $7 side dish we ordered (and they were nice enough to NOT charge us for the other side dish we DIDN'T get). DON'T go there. Go to the Lawry's accross the street. But stay at the James. (BTW- its not a 3-star hotel like the website lists- its at least 4-star)"
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I read the reviews on Trip Advisor for this property which had it ranked as #1 in Chicago. I got a king room overlooking Michigan Ave. The view was beautiful. The room was also impeccable. Nice and bright; very fresh and modern. I find it very hard to fault any Sofitel's. The service; attentiveness of staff; cleanliness and luxury are always top notch. Location was great; head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe's and restaurants. Straight ahead of the hotel on Michigan Ave is a shoppers paradise. A great place to stay; and much better value than Park Hyatt. I do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy; such as for the internet. When you are paying top dollar; a few inclusions would be nice."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"My stay at the Sofitel was great. I loved the location it was in. From the moment I arrived the experince was great; the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too. I thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable. The room service was excllent and they were very friendly. Checkout was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay."
?,Hilton Chicago;"The Hilton Chicago is one of the best Hotels I have ever had the good fortune to lodge at in my entire life. It is an extremely luxirious hotel located on the ""Cultural Michigan Avenue Mile""; and it overlooks Grant Park; Lake Michigan; and Museum Campus. In addition to overlooking those wonderful sights; it's also located conveniently close to Chicago's convention center; McCormick Place Convention Center; as well as the business center; shopping and theatre. Furthermore; there are a myriad of attractions close to the hotel; such as Millenium Park; Buckingham Park; and the Sears Tower. The amenities offered by the Hilton Chicago hotel include 100% wireless Internet access in all guest rooms; 27"" inch flat screen televisions; a Serenity Bed; and two-line direct dial phones. And on top of all that; the hotel is pet friendly! I'll definitely be staying here again."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a four star hotel that is minutes aways from the Magnificent mile; Navy Peir; The museum of contemperary art; lake michigan and upscale boutiques. This hotel is great for tourest. it has 450 great rooms and 33 high end sweets. It has a modern diesighn and rich arcitechusall legacy. IT has great food and out door dinning it also has a great veiws; while drinking wine and champane cotails in there amazing bar. Overall this hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Hotel Monaco is in a really great location; only a block away from the Miracle mile and a couple of blocks from Millenium Park. Sears Tower is also well within walking distance and if you don't mind walking you won't have a problem walking to Greek Town and Lincoln Park (we did). The daily; complimentary; wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out. If you can; leave your car behind; you won't need it and the parking is quite pricey; which is not very surprising considering the location. Everything was clean; fresh and modern and the staff very helpful. The only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around ""the loop"" was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"We had a king deluxe room for 2 nights. We reserved the room through the hotel website with AAA discount. We paid $180/nt. We enjoy boutique hotels; as they have so much more personality and personal service. This hotel was no exception. Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. The room was clean; well decorated; spacious and quiet. We were offered at check-in a room with a view; but warned it was across from the elevator; so we decided to take the quiet; large room with no view. The location of the hotel was perfect for us; we saw Wicked while in Chicago and had no problem walking to the theater. We also walked the Magnificient Mile and found the location perfect (we like to walk). We had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience. We ate room service for breakfast each morning; and the food was good and the portions were quite large. We would definitely stay here again."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"This is an absolutely exquisite hotel; at a great location; and boasting superb amenities. I was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on Michigan Ave. The hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk. I appreciated the homey; well-designed interior and views of the city. It was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so I didn't have to wander the city for my late night meal. This will definitely be my hotel of choice when I return to the city."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Having had a great stay at the Monaco last Fall with friends; I was disappointed (initially) to arrive on Saturday with husband and find that they didn't have our Quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for Sat. eve. BUT they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following: found us a nice room at the neighboring Swissotel and paid for it! Gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. Paid for our valet parking $33 that eve. So naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for Sunday eve (when they did have room); we said yes. When we returned; they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $139 quikbook rate! Now that's what I call a recovery!!"
?,Hilton Chicago;The Chicago Hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic. The hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city. The room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful. I can't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there.
?,James Chicago;"We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids. We reserved the ""Family Adventurer with Paul Frank"". It's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium. We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes; which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children's Museum. My kids had a ball. We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored. All in all; a great weekend where my kids were the focus. The adults certainly weren't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning."
?,Hilton Chicago;"We had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the Hilton - I am so glad we did the hotel was clean; hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing. We knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"My husband and I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for our wedding anniversary - and what a pleasant stay we had! From the first moment we walked in; we were overwhelmed at the classy elegance of the lobby. I casually mentioned that it was our anniversary; and after we came back from dinner; we found champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room. The staff was professional but friendly; and made us feel so welcome. The room was immaculate; the furnishings were so plush - we didn't really want to go home! Room service was prompt; and the views were spectacular! We are definitely going to make this visit a yearly repeat."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I was very satisfied after staying at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. The service was excellent; as the staff was very helpful and polite. The beds were very comfortable; and the rooms were very spacious. I will definitely be returning to this hotel."
?,Hilton Chicago;"This is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of US cities. The entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. The bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. It is located on South Michigan directly across the road from Grant and Millenium Park. It also has a free shuttle to the Water Tower in the heart of the Magnificent Mile. For Blues fans; Buddy Guy's Legends Club is situated immediately behind the Hotel. Highly recommended."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"This hotel is beautiful; it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it. The location is wonderful;it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier; which was a great place to show the children on our vacation. We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car;and the valet was very nice and helpful. I also take my work with me everywhere I go;So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus. They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing. This place is great for the price; due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is. This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business. It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable. The rooms are spacious; great beds; pillows and linen. The bathroom has a great shower and bath. WiFi works really well and the desk is large. The staff are wonderful. The location is great for shopping; spa's; Starbucks and hairdressers. I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago; and I've been to this hotel at least 4 times. the rooms are clean; wonderfully designed and comfortable. The staff is friendly; service focused - and the restuarant is great; especially for the breakfast fruit crepes. Love this hotel. It's a great location; very good and consistent service and quality ."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"After reading the reviews on this hotel; I decided to book my stay for July 4th weekend here and I am glad I did; this hotel is absolutely beautiful. Our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows. I do have 1 complaint. The bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great; but other than that I loved it. I would definitely stay there again."
?,James Chicago;"My stay at the The James was perfect. My room was thoughtfully designed: the lighting; the storage space; the bar area; the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at. The staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating. The restaurant (Primehouse) echoed the above. Great service and one of the best steaks I've had in a very long time."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and I could not be more pleased. The hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern; stylish rooms. The rooms are something truly special with huge; soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt. The bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower/tub. If that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32"" LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system. When you finally make it out of your room; down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant. It is called Cafe des Architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic French techniques. Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile. A full dinner including appetizer; main course; and dessert can be had for $45; amazing. If you are looking for a modern; urban; chic hotel in Chicago then look no further; the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel is your only real choice."
?,James Chicago;"Do you want to stay in a sleek modern hotel that gives you all of the amenities to conduct your business? Then the James Hotel in Chicago is the place for you. Superb clean lines and sophistication welcomes you on first sight. Followed by spacious rooms; luxurious linens; and all-natural Kiehl's body shampoos and lotions. I absolutely loved my stay at the James Hotel in downtown Chicago. The bathrooms have raised sinks; and all of the luxurious amenities you would want. I absolutely loved the natural wood feel mingled with a modern touch. I felt at home in a very clean and modern atmosphere. I definitely would stay again; and plan to stay at the James in New York as well"
?,James Chicago;"Stayed for 2 nights at The James; wonderful location 2 mins walk to Michigan Avenue with all the shops. Staff here were all incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly. Nothing was too much trouble. Rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable I have slept in. Room was very clean; had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a 42in flat screen tv. There was a bar area with stereo; mini bar and coffee maker. There was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area. Bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo; conditioner; shower gel and body lotion. Hotel is also ""pet friendly"". There was even a large bowl of iced water and a barrel of dog biscuits at the front door of the hotel !!!. Pets even had their own options on the room sevice menu."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"After some deliberation I booked the Sofitel Water Tower Place for a 3 night stop-over in June. This was my first visit to Chicago and it turned out that we had a really great time. We loved our rooms; which were just the basic type on the lower floors but they were very well appointed. The decor is modern and personally I liked it a lot. The rooms were pleasant and airy and the bed extremely comfortable. The hotel location is just perfect; close to the shops on Michagan Avenue; and the beach at Oak Street. Lovely restaurants close by and nightlife in Rush Street is just steps away. The area although bustling was peaceful and quiet. We could walk to most places and I would not hesitate to stay here again. The hotel staff very helpful; always smiling and ready to help; from the doormen to the helpful lady at Conceriage. I would not hesitate at all to stay at Sofitel Water Tower Place next time I'm in Chicago; in fact I look forward to my next visit."
?,Hilton Chicago;"My stay here was superb. The view from my windows was stunning; as I looked out I could see the beautiful Grant Park. The room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting. The bed was very comfortable. The wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips. THe hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca. Overall I thouroughly enjoyed my stay here."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"As I walked into the hotel I was greeted warm heartedly. They took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly. I was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom. Also; I was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient. Overall; I was very happy with my stay at this hotel."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"My stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago was amazing. The staff are polite and well poised; eager to give a helping hand in a short notice. To someone like me; who had never even been in the city of Chicago; it really gave me a good feeling throughout my whole trip. The rooms; hallways and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy; and whenver I went out; I would always find my room perfect ; be it for a night of undwinding after one of my conferences; or just to hit the mattress and sleep. During my stay; I stopped at their restuarant where I had one of the best American style meal in a while. Overall; the Hotel Monaco is a place I would surely stay at again if given the chance to visit Chicago for a second time. It is truely exceptional."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"I stayed at the monaco for the Labor day weekend when I visited my family in Chicago. It is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life. clean; comfortable and pretty. The rooms were clean and the staff is very caring. I needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink. The front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes. I will recommend Monaco to anyone who will be staying in the Chicago area."
?,Hilton Chicago;"Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed. Check-in was quick; easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time. We were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant. It made getting ready to go out much quicker! The hotel location is great opposite the park; which is a must see. Although located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave. Would also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping. For breakfast I would recommend grabbing a muffin; croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant. For evening entertainment Kitty O'Sheas is a must. Typical Irish bar with good drinks and live music. Finally the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever. I would have taken it home if I could! Definately made for a good nights sleep."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"Sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel; even if you tried. Such was the case with Sofitel; where we'd never stayed before. It's a sleek; modern; sophisticated hotel with European touches. We spent three days there on a leisure weekend; we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the Hancock Building; at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. The room was average sized; well-appointed; everything in it worked; and it had a fabulous view of the Chicago high-rise jungle; including snippets of the lake. The public areas were wonderfully decorated. The restaurant served a good breakfast at; for Chicago; reasonable prices. The staff was excellent. My wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. The staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her."
?,James Chicago;"The James Hotel met and exceeded our expectations. A haven of cool; uncluttered comfort in a hot; crowded but congenial city. Located within steps of some of the greatest art; architecture; culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in North America; the staff of the James provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited. The check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm; restorative oasis. It is difficult to over-praise the friendly; attentive staff; this is a hotel that truly has its act together! The day before our visit ended; we experienced problems with the room's air conditioner. When the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem; we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the Chicago skyline. We eagerly await the opening of new James Hotels in other cities."
?,James Chicago;"My significant other and I recently spent 3 nights at The James and on the last day I said; ""I wish we could stay longer"". That good! The room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door. Everything is high tech. Plasma TV; CD/Radio; Projection alarm clock (love that so much bought one today). If you wanted room service you got it from David Burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful. They even have a four legged friend menu. The bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes/slippers and upscale products provided. The bed was the best in a hotel ever. Linens were crip; white and fresh. Maid service twice daily with turn down service. Safe in room; ice delivered; iron; hairdryer all top of the line. The filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor. Mid-century style with funky chair/ottman; cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home. The staff was courteous and accommodating. The library; free internet access; in room wifi were extras we didn't expect . Bar/lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby. Funky artwork. Location; location; location. The best place we've ever stayed not only in Chicago. Highly recommend."
?,Hilton Chicago;"My family and I have just had a two week holiday in Chicago; and we stayed for a week at the Hilton Towers. We had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel. The sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable. If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels; maybe this wouldn't be your thing. However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz; you will be bowled over by this hotel. The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby. Tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating. We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place!"
?,James Chicago;"I believe I can not describe how amazing was our stay at The James. Service was impecable; from the door man to the front desk. Location could not be better. Yes; you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor; but; come on; you are downtown; what do you expect....Overall noise was not in a level to bother us. The only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm...PM not AM? Go figure..."
?,Hilton Chicago;We chose to stay at the Hilton Chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close! What I didn't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. I can't remember when I got a better night's sleep. The staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. We'll be returning to the Hilton Chicago the next time we're in town!
?,James Chicago;"Great hotel! Went to see the Museum of Contemporary Art which was great; but this hotel almost had it beat! The rooms (and even halls) are very beautifully done. Great service too. A+"
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and I must say; it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. In the past; I've always stayed at the Marriott or the Hilton so this time I thought I'd go with a boutique hotel. I've stayed at some of the Kimpton properties in San Francisco so I was delighted that they are running the Monaco. Basically; I like the friendly; real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places I've used before. I do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill I normally use. South Water Kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. I really dug the complimentary coffee; high speed internet and newspaper. I get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the Monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. All in all; I will return to the Monaco. It's a great alternative."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;Excellent service! Clean and spacious rooms with a great view of downtown Chicago. Location is excellent for exploring the main sights and the Golden Mile. Great concierge service. Pricey though... Don't valet if you don't need to.
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"We loved this hotel and would definitely come back. Initially we weren't given a goldfish; which was disappointing; but then we left a tip for the housekeeper; and she rewarded us with one. We had fun sipping wine and playing Wii in the lobby every afternoon. The staff were quite friendly and helpful; even printing our boarding passes for us. Our room was very comfortable; with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. At first we were worried about noise; since our room was next to the elevator; but we hardly heard it; and didn't notice any street noise either. The hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated; well-lit; and ideally located."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;Best hotel in an excellent location I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a Business purpose. My 1 year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room. The front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly . The room service was also good. The room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good . I like the decor of the room. The French restaurant in Sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining . I will surely prefer to stay in Sofitel on a next time travel to Chicago.
?,James Chicago;"This was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. For this week's vacation in Chicago; I heard several recommendations regarding lodging; but the James Chicago was mentioned most emphatically. I expected an experience of comfort; luxury and customer satisfaction; but I was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. The design is breathtaking -- modern; clean; stylish; sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby; shops and restaurants; to the stunning guest rooms themselves. My family and I felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in; and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. Far from a traditional hotel experience; this was like moving into chic; exclusive downtown apartment; and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. Impressive; too; was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources. From its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage; the James offers a unique perspective on its place in the world; and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. It's a respect that shows through; too; in other areas: support for artistic organizations; charities and other programs of merit; as well as Chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay; whether for a weekend; a week; or longer. The James Chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit Chicago. In fact; we may visit again solely to stay at the James!"
?,James Chicago;"The thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable. The room was very clean; the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot. Other than that it was a great place to stay."
?,Hilton Chicago;"My husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago;and enjoyed every minute of it! The bedrooms are immaculate;and the linnens are very soft. We also appreciated the free wifi;as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in Chicago. The bathroom was quite spacious;and I loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos. Their service was amazing;and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool. I would recommend staying here to anyone."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"This was a great hotel; one of the nicest that we have stayed in a long time. My wife was absolutely thrilled with the staff and we couldn't believe the KimptonKids program at the site. We will be back next time we stop in town. We cannot think of a better place to stay."
?,James Chicago;"This hotel is great! I love its interior design of the room. Customer service is excellent! And its gym and spa are gorgeous. If you need to go to Chicago; this hotel would be your best choice! You can also check its website for the special offer; I found a great deal on it!"
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"This hotel was gorgeous! I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future. The staff was friendly; the room was clean; comfortable and very well decorated. The restaurant/ room service was also exceptional. The food was delicious and the room service was prompt. This hotel is also in a great location. It is close to everything anyone may need; such as shopping; food and attractions."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"If you are traveling anywhere near Lake Michigan within the next year or less; I would highly recommend staying at The Sofitel Hotel. Unbeatable elegance; fine dining; and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. Along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. If there were such a thing as a 10 star rating; The Sofitel would surely have it. My visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. Located minutes from everything in downtown Chicago; one would hardly want to leave. Fine dining; dancing; and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting; or social event in town. The Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave."
?,James Chicago;"I try to stay at the James every time I happen to be in Chicago. There are other good choices in town; but nobody has what the James offers: superior service - aka class meets efficiency -; metropolitan design and comfort with an attention to details I found only at the W in Seoul; and what always plays a role meaning a convenient location ... Then they get to you with small unexpected touches that make the difference ie: I was about to take off and drive North; it was a hot July day...one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water. A small gesture. Unexpected and appreciated. The management AND the staff understand what we expect and more importantly; what we need. AND they consistenly execute against that."
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"I just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - what a treat! The hotel website offers a great rate; and what I found was affordable luxury. I asked for a high floor & found myself with a fabulous view; in a room where there was an orchid spray in the bathroom; terrycloth robes and slippers; turndown service; Roger Gallet toiletries; a fluffy down conforter; and a wonderful pillowtop bed. The bathroom was so clean that it sparkled. The service was impeccable as well. Even my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous basket of excellent croissants; brioches; & pain au chocolat. The decor was unique & the location convenient. Check out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby. This is a topnotch hotel."
?,Hilton Chicago;"in the windy city ;this is a very good place.amazing rooms and service.everything is a walking distance .An absolute must for business trio as ease with which you can conduct and schedule meetings here is unbeatable. Good decor and impishly modern"
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel. Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour; and the accomodations were quite nice (our beds were very soft and comfortable). We had excellent views of the river from our rooms. The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town; with easy access to public transportation nearby. My friends actually received the goldfish upon request; which they enjoyed. Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above; but it was minimal. Price seemed very resonable to us for the location. Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again."
?,James Chicago;"I stayed in on of The James one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in Chicago visiting my daughter. The pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities I forgot to pack and left them in my room for me. Later in the week I treated myself to an Asha Massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services. Afterward I smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed I'd been in years. My room was clean and modern; yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding. I'll certainly be staying with them again in the future."
?,Hilton Chicago;"The Downtown Chicago Hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. Staying with a Hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always; the room was clean and impeccably neat; the staff friendly and very capable. The wireless access and big flat screen TV were an added plus too! Best of all; it is a pet-friendly hotel; something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. Thanks; Chicago Hilton; for a great stay!"
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago! I was very pleasantly surprised; as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway; and he usually picks bad places-haha. Anyway; the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. It was busy and the line was a little long; but it moved quickly. The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good; especially since it seemed to be near full. The room was clean and spacious (especially considering it's a city hotel). We made a lot of use of the concierge; since again; it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans. He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy! It was also great being near the theater district; and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room! very trendy. My husband is not as easily impressed; but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. Overall; really nice stay in a four star; or probably four and half star hotel!"
?,Hilton Chicago;"We loved the hotel. When I see other posts about it being shabby I can't for the life of me figure out what they are talking about. Rooms were large with TWO bathrooms; lobby was fabulous; pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym; staff was courteous. For us; the location was great--across the street from Grant Park with a great view of Buckingham Fountain and close to all the museums and theatres. I'm sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the Magnificent Mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location. Got it for $105 on Hotwire. What a bargain for such a nice hotel."
?,James Chicago;"Our stay at the James in late last August exceeded our expectations. My husband was in Chicago for a business trip; and I tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life. When we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors; and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly. He met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions. The lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive. Our room was also very clean. I could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. The bed was comfortable; and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in. It has been awhile since I have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin. My husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month. The bathroom was also impressive. The water pressure was not something I had to mess with to get perfect; and the heater took no time at all to warm up. Even though I had brought my own shampoo and conditioner; I did give the amenities in the bathroom a try; and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. I did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms; however; my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities. I truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel; and if we are ever in the Chicago area again we will definitely be staying here. This hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure."

?,James Chicago;"Just returned to Seattle after a visit home to Chicago and I loved The James!!! Recently stayed at the Ritz at Water Tower and the Dana around the corner--both of which were great but The James was perfect. Secured the room through a package w/ American Express for a great deal so though the view wasn't great the space; decor and location can't be beat. Staff was friendly; courteous and very helpful; the gym was substantial and though I didn't try the restaurants/room service; the menus looked yummy. I've stayed in Chgo in that area on avg 1-2s/mo over the past three years and the James is at the top my list now. If you can get a good deal; I highly recommend!!"
?,Hilton Chicago;"My stay was quick but awesome. After a long day; seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner; but then i saw the self-serve kiosks. i was checked in with keys in hand in under 3 minutes. in the morning i was able to check out on the TV in my room. the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its 1927 origins. The bed was FABULOUSLY comfortable. i wish i could live there. they have many rooms wtih 2 bathrooms. i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didn't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms. talk about squeals of delight. that was about 7 years ago in virginia beach. i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms; but it's the first time i've seen this since. what a great feature!"
?,Sofitel Chicago Water Tower;"We just arrived from a 3 nights stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower. It was faboulous. Fine Linen; nice room with bigs windows; bathroom with a shower; flat TV. Check for the deals on the Sofitel website; we had 3 nights for the price of two !"
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"Upon entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago; i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building. The old fashioned furnishings; the wonderful view; and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel. At first i had been skeptical; but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone. As i entered my room; the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me. During my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool; winding down every night with a comforting massage. I would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance; but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities."
?,Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel;"This will be the only hotel I will never forget in my life. Hotel Monaco Chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice. Whether if it's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite; all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based; so it suits ones personality. Even if you are a super sized person; like me with a height of 6""4'; there are special ""Tall Rooms"" just for you. My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel. Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. Before I go to a meeting; I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service. After I come back from the meeting; I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines. I just didn't want to leave that hotel; so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago; I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago."
