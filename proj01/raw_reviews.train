 <s> Swissotelchicago – I could go on and on about the food here . <s> Their steak was cooked just the way I like it and I had a good dining experience every night . <s> Some of the waitresses talked too much ;  but they were friendly and had stories about people from all over the country . <s> I really enjoyed that the restaurant was just down the steps from my room ;  but this was pretty much all that interested me . <s> I didn’t fly all the way to Chicago just for food . <s> Maybe I missed something ;  but it seemed like everything else was off . <s> The concierge told me I could walk to the Grand Park in minutes ;  but it took me almost half an hour . <s> I did see some really cool birds or seagulls on the way ;  but I didn’t know why he’d say it was closer than it is ? <s> And the walls were really thin . <s> I could hear giggling from the wall opposite of my bed all night long . <s> And for some reason ;  there weren’t any outlets near my bed ;  so I had to leave my phone across the room near the sink outlet to charge it at night . <s> It made using an alarm the next day a little annoying… I’m not sure why my company recommended this place ;  but maybe I just got a bad room ? <s> For Top Class Treatment Choose Hotel Allegro . <s> In all of my years of buisness travel and vacationing ;  I have never been more happy with the service at a hotel than I was at Hotel Allegro . <s> I searched many hotel websites looking for the perfect hotel to spend our honeymoon ;  and Hotel Allegro seemed like the right choice . <s> Soon as I walked into to their elaborate lobby area ;  it was like I was a big shot on Wallstreet ;  the service was excellent and the best part ;  they allow animals . <s> They treated my little dog Johnny like he was royalty . <s> They have everything you could ever need in a hotel ;  from in room spa service to a workout center . <s> They even made sure that I had all of my drinks and amentites ready for the Monday night Bears game . <s> If I were to give have to rate it from a 1 - 10 . <s> Id have to give it a 10 many times over . <s> I highly recommend Hotel Allegro in Chicago Illinois and I will be back again . <s> There is a great difference between a Hyatt Regency Hotel ;  and a normal hotel . <s> The thing that I did not like about this hotel was the smoke section of the non smoking section was really close to each other . <s> I get really uncomfortable when I am in a crowded area ;  and people are smoking their lungs out . <s> Even though this hotel is really glamourous ;  has a nice bar ;  a nice restaurant ;  great music ;  it is still not a good stay if you don't like people smoking beside you . <s> We went to Chicago to see an exhibit at the Art Institute and selected the Fairmont because it was so close . <s> Although the lobby is still being renovated ;  our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive . <s> The room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate . <s> The only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished . <s> The maid does not do that ;  and by bedtime on the first night ;  we still didn't have coffee . <s> We called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply . <s> The restaurant is a little underwhelming ;  but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks ;  we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did . <s> After having stayed in close to a dozen different Chicago hotels ;  this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return . <s> I booked my reservations at The Talbott Hotel in hopes of finding luxury and excellent service . <s> What I actually got was far less than that . <s> When I first arrived to check in ;  the woman at the desk was very impolite and looked rather bored . <s> It took her over 5 minutes to even find my reservation in the computer system ! <s> And I won't go into detail about how she messed up with my room keys and had to give me a second set ! <s> When I finally got to my room ;  the first thing I noticed was that it smelled stale . <s> The air in the room literally smelled like it had been in that room ;  without any fresh air ;  for years . <s> I soon discovered my bathroom toilet had a leak ;  as well ;  and every time you flushed the toilet ;  water would trickle out from the base onto the floor . <s> Talk about concerning . <s> I reported this to the desk ;  and the fellow who answered promised someone would be up right away to fix it . <s> No one showed up until the next day ;  and very early in the morning ;  I might add . <s> Later ;  I called room service and asked for a bottle of wine . <s> It took them half an hour to deliver it to my room ! <s> And it wasn't even chilled by the time it showed up ;  either ;  it was lukewarm . <s> Overall ;  my experience here was not very pleasant ;  and I don't recommend booking with this hotel . <s> Although the InterContinental Chicago Hotel is located on  " The Magnificent Mile ;  "  our entire experience as guests there was anything but  .... believe me ;  the  " magnificence "  ends at the hotel entrance ! <s> From check-in to check-out ;  our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific . <s> First ;  there was an error with our reservation ;  and once we got to our room ;  we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked ;  so down I trudged to the registration desk -- where I had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes -- to ask for help . <s> The first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to TV noise coming from the next room ;  we weren't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls . <s> Then ;  dog tired the next morning -- even though we had hung a  " Do Not Disturb "  sign on our door handle -- in barged the maid all bright-eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand . <s> Following that rude awakening ;  I was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife ;  who ;  upon entering the bathroom to take her shower ;  was greeted by an incredibly large roach ! <s> Breakfast -- actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel -- were served cold and were somewhat tasteless . <s> We were routinely ignored by the concierge ;  who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him . <s> Trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in . <s> Of course ;  there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart . <s> Getting out of the InterContinental Chicago was ;  believe me ;  the best part of our experience as guests there . <s> Last week I stayed at the Hilton Chicago for 4 days and 3 nights and I was very pleased with the experience . <s> As soon as I approached the front desk ;  I knew right away the staff was friendly and courteous . <s> They had given me a list of local attractions such as the Museum of Science and Industry ;  the Broadcast Museum ;  the Ford Center For The Performing Arts and Willis Tower . <s> I stayed in a junior suite which included a king size bed ;  a 27 inch television ;  non-allergenic feather pillows and a variety of other amenities . <s> The indoor pool was rather large as well as the gym which includes countless treadmills and even a jogging track . <s> Eating in the area is not a problem as the Hilton Chicago is home to Kitty O'Sheas which is a restaurant offering authentic Irish fare . <s> In conclusion ;  I had a wonderful time staying here and I can not wait to plan my return trip to the Hilton Chicago . <s> The Good - excellent location ;  neighborhood is pretty and quiet ;  close to shops ;  restaurants ;  the waterfront ;  close to train / subway station ;  etc The Bad - Very old decor ;  which isn't a big deal ;  but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor . <s> We were supposed to have a king bed  ( anniversary trip )  we were given two double beds and told we would be switched - that never happened . <s> The shower / tub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower . <s> Who wants to shower in someone else's dirty water even if it is your wife . <s> The indifferent - room was a decent size ;  bed linens were okay ;  staff was mediocre to marginally rude <s> We were amazed by this hotel . <s> The first great part is the location . <s> Its so close to some of the great shopping the city has to offer . <s> The view from the terrace suite at night was breathtaking looking over Chicago . <s> They even had a florist ;  as I bought my wife a rose . <s> The menus ;  the lobby ;  everything was fantastic . <s> The room was clean when we arrived as it was every time we came back to it each day . <s> I didn't use the fitness center but it looked very nice ;  I did however visit the bar .... and when i return to Chicago ;  I will again . <s> I was disappointed in my stay at The James . <s> I am on a strict gluten free diet and was told the hotel restaurant could accomodate my needs . <s> Each time I sat down for a meal ;  I would explain my dietary needs to the waiter . <s> Most times ;  I ended up having to send the plate back because some gluten item was included . <s> My wife has sleep apnea and when we made our reservations ;  I made sure to ask if there was a room available with an outlet near the bed so that she could plug in her CPAP machine . <s> I was assured that this was no problem . <s> However ;  when we arrived at the hotel ;  we had to request a room change because there was no outlet near the bed . <s> We had to wait in the lobby for sometime because the room we were moved to was not yet finished benig cleaned . <s> Overall ;  it was not an entirely horrific stay ;  but I expected more out of a hotel of this supposed caliber . <s> Next time I visit Chicago ;  I will be staying at another hotel . <s> Hilton Chicago - I would say Hilton Chicago is one of the best hotel Iâ€™ve ever stayed . <s> When I first entered the hotel ;  I was amazed by the luxurious decoration of the lobby and the welcoming staff to help me check in . <s> The receptionist was so thoughtful to put me in a room on the 10th floor so that I could enjoy the splendid view of Michigan Lake . <s> When I walked into the room ;  I was really impressed by the size and layout of the room . <s> I spent the evening watching sports while enjoying the sunset over the lake . <s> How can you beat that ! <s> The location of the hotel was also perfect since it has lots of nice restaurants and bars within walking distance and itâ€™s so nice to take a walk around the area after the dinner . <s> In all ;  I loved Hilton Chicago and would recommend anyone who plan to spend a great night at Chicago ! <s> I had a large ;  roomy ;  clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom ;  big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise . <s> Customer Service here was absolutely incredible ;  from the doorman to the front desk ;  to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when I requested it . <s> Sure ;  you get a little outside noise ;  but it is a big city ;  that is not unusual ! <s> I really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it . <s> I recently had the displeasure of staying at the Conrad Chicago . <s> Although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites ;  my experience was anything but pleasent . <s> First of all ;  they tell you that check in time is at 3pm . <s> Well I arrived at the hotel at 3 : 30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready . <s> After waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready ;  I decided to go settle in . <s> The carpets in the room smelled old and musty . <s> Additionally ;  the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips ;  scratches ;  and dents in the furniture . <s> Although the bed was comfortable ;  I just couldn't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet . <s> It was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and I did not have a very good nights sleep . <s> All in all ;  my experience was not the worst I've ever had ;  but far from anything worth writing home about . <s> Hotel is located 1 / 2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you're traveling with luggage and / or kids . <s> They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking / valet fees . <s> Rooms feature either double or king sized beds ;  no queen beds at all . <s> If you want a little extra leg room in your bed ;  the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff . <s> Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge ;  too . <s> I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel . <s> Staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in Aria restaurant ;  to the maid who cleaned my room . <s> The rooms were recently updated ;  with large flat-screen TV's ;  beautiful linens ;  and exceptional toiletries in each room . <s> My room even had a view of Monroe St .  harbor . <s> It is truly a first-rate hotel . <s> Location is south of the river and east of Michigan Ave  --  as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way  ( if that's possible in downtown Chicago )  ;  however its location significantly lowers street noise . <s> The hotel has excellent access to Millennium Park ;  the Aon center  ( there is a connecting concourse )  ;  and is about 4 blocks from shopping on North Michigan Ave . <s> I ate dinner in Aria and it was fantastic ! <s> Room service for breakfast was quite good as well . <s> Overall ;  I'd stay again in a minute if I had business in the loop ;  or leisure plans in Millennium or Grant Parks . <s> Great ;  awesome service . <s> Seriously ;  the people are amazing . <s> That ;  and the nice bartender who serves after last call  ( at least ;  that's what I was told - I of course don't drink )  save this place from one star . <s> But seriously blah ;  small ;  non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of  $ 725 / night ;  even in a major city ;  the rooms better be awesome . <s> I've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for  $ 350 / night . <s>  ( Good thing I had a corporate rate . <s>  )  And my room was not especially big ;  despite what the below reviews say . <s> But here's the main problem . <s> Even on the 10th floor ;  the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 ;  and 6 : 15 ;  and 6 : 30 ;  and 6 : 45 ;  and 6 : 50 ;  and 6 : 55 ;  and ... and ;  well ;  I finally got up and said screw it ;  let's greet the day . <s> Maybe everyone else was already up ;  but somehow I doubt it . <s> Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons . <s> I was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton ;  but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment . <s> It started with check in ;  I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed ;  but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms  ( OK ;  rather rudely ! <s>  )  that because of some banker's convention that was going on ;  I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left . <s> It was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience ! <s> The room itself was OK ;  nothing special though . <s> The cleaning staff must've just been through ;  because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air . <s> The internet jack wasn't working . <s> It took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it ;  no apologies given . <s> For the price ;  I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton . <s> I guess they're really no better than anyone else these days ! <s> I love the free breakfast and dinners on weeknights . <s> The hotel is clean and nice rooms The pool needs some updating ( but kids don't care )  My friend and I took our granddaughters for a grandma grandaughter outing and this hotel was perfect <s> Sheraton Chicago - Do not let all the decor in lobby fool you ;  the rooms at the Sheraton do not match up . <s> I stayed here for two nights ;  and I had to ask for two room changes :  the first room had a faulty shower ;  and the second seemed to be in the process of cleaning when I entered . <s> I also was not a big fan of the unnecessary extra furniture in the room :  the uncomfortable chair was arranged so that one can barely see the television while being blasted in the face by the air conditioning . <s> On top of that ;  the  $ 199 a night rate does not include free internet ;  something that I feel should be commonplace nowadays . <s> The restaurants downstairs were alright ;  but one can definitely get better for the same or even lower price outside ;  especially in downtown Chicago . <s> While the Sheraton may have a pretty good reputation across the country ;  the Sheraton Chicago does not meet those expectations ;  and I would recommend staying elsewhere . <s> THIS HOTEL IS FANTASTIC . <s> I stayed there on my way through Chicago towards Arizona ;  and could not believe the great quality of the hotel . <s> I'd have thought I was in a Vegas suite . <s> Really polite staff ;  great housekeeping ;  and amazing prices . <s> On my way out ;  I was telling the manager about how much I'd loved the hotel ;  and he even offered me an extra night there ! <s> You can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly 24 hours . <s> I stayed in this hotel for a week and I was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel . <s> I was shocked and disapointed with my stay ;  Here are some of my gripes - Room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb - Breakfast service was slow and impolite - Hotel rationed shampoo  ( one bottle for two people sharing and did not refill a bottle that was less than half full )  . <s> - We also shared a bar of soap . <s> I was so disappointed with this hotel ;  I paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay . <s> If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways ;  then this view is for you . <s> I asked for a room facing the river ;  I get a room facing a Brick Wall . <s> That really pissed me off . <s> From all the great reviews ;  I was expecting better . <s> Before I came here ;  I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC ;  and that was awesome . <s> There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away . <s> The wine hour was ok . <s> I was hoping there would be something better food ;  but I guess that's why it's a wine hour . <s> I ordered room service one night . <s> There wasn't really anywhere to eat it ;  so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv . <s> This was my first time coming to Chicago ;  and I think it will be my last . <s> Just thoroughly disappointed . <s> talbotthotel - Stayed at the Talbott during my last trip to Chicago ;  thought I'd try it after not loving the Whitehall down the street . <s> Unfortunately ;  I didn't like the Talbott much better . <s> The rooms seemed a little dark for my taste ;  and the bathrooms were a tad small . <s> While the hotel is close to some of the main areas of Chicago ;  this resulted in a lot of traffic noise for the room  ( nothing like late-night honking during an in-room movie )  . <s> The hotel amenities were of reasonable quality but frankly just not worth the price . <s> Hello ;  I recently stayed at the Affinia hotel in Chicago ;  and was very unhappy when I learned of additional charges upon arrival . <s> When I made the reservations over the phone there was no mention of any internet or parking fees . <s> When I arrive I'm told fee to valet park is  $ 49 per day ;  plus another  $ 10 for internet . <s> This is just plain ridiculous ;  and will remember not to stay here in future . <s> There's too many other fine hotels that don't charge these fees . <s> Omni Hotel Chicago - I stayed in the Omni hotel when I had been to Chicago on a business trip . <s> I had checked in online and was pleased to know that the keys were waiting for me at the front desk . <s> The room was spacious with nice comfortable bed ;  with a large bathroom and a hot shower . <s> The view from the room was not that great and even though I could hear a little noise from outside ;  it did not disturb my sleep . <s> Room service staff were friendly and extremely helpful . <s> The Wi-Fi bandwidth was good and helped me access my work computer without any hassles and disconnections . <s> The hotel was close to where I worked and also to Magnificent Mile and several other shopping attractions and theatres . <s> This hotel was not worth it . <s> From the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out ;  the staff were rude and contemptuous . <s> Rooms were only serviceable ;  and certainly did not live up to the pompous self-descriptions on the website . <s> The bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient . <s> The 'fitness centre' was tiny and poor . <s> We would not come here again . <s> Swissotel Chicago - I booked a classic king room for my interview in Chicago . <s> The room is pretty large for its price . <s> The modern stype decoration gave me a great mood for my interview . <s> Great hotel with beautiful scenery ! <s> The staff was wonderful and the rooms were comfortable and spacious . <s> They even had a docking station for my iPod ! <s> We stayed here because of all the great reviews ;  and it's all true . <s> We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything ;  everyone ;  and the location . <s> Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer . <s> Gibson's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple . <s> This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago . <s> It should also have more than three stars . <s> I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard ;  and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those . <s> Depending on the room you get ;  any price under  $ 250 would be a good deal . <s> Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it . <s> Stayed in a Junior Suite which was beautiful and spacious . <s> It had the largest flat screen tv I have ever seen in a hotel  ( great excuse to catch up on some movies )  The breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice . <s> The service was top notch . <s> Stayed in a lower floor in the East tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty . <s> The Shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the Field musium was amazing . <s> Chicago remains tied with London as my favourite city . <s> I stayed at the Swissotel for a business trip the first week of Aug 2007 . <s> I arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night . <s> However ;  this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor . <s> EXCELLENT view of the city ;  river and Lake Michigan . <s> In fact ;  I would say the corner room of the Swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity . <s> The room was huge ;  and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice . <s> The hotel is very convieniently located to the Magnificient Mile and Millenium Park . <s> Would very much recommend this hotel ;  and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor . <s> We stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful . <s> First off ;  the staff is excellent . <s> All of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile . <s> The hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that Chicago has to offer . <s> All of the shopping of Michigan Avenue was just steps from our room . <s> We decided to go for the Shedd Aquarium package . <s> We started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our  " all access pass "  to the aquarium  ( very cool !  )  . <s> After our long days of sightseeing  ( and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar )  ;  it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant ;  but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city . <s> To top it all off ;  they have the most incredible shower that I've ever used  ( and ;  even better ;  it's all  " green "  )  . <s> What more can I say ? <s> The Millennium Knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable . <s> I highly recommend it ! <s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago is just minutes from Navy Pier ;  Michigan Avenue ;  the Chicago Opera Theater ;  The House of Blues ;  and the hottest night clubs . <s> At  $ 200 . 00 per night ;  you can expect the very best from your staff ;  and your accomodations . <s> When I arrived for my weekend stay ;  I was greeted by a pleasant surprise of wall art ;  and eclectic style . <s> After reaching my room ;  I was able to relax in peace on the numerous pillows . <s> I didn't choose to use the spa this trip ;  but when I come back ;  it will be the first item on my list ! <s> The business office was great ;  because I had a last minute emergency with work- thank goodness for cocktail hour . <s> Breakfast was delicious . <s> I have already told a friend from Naperville that the next time I'm in town ;  she'll have to stay at Amalfi with me ;  instead of commuting . <s> She really missed out ! <s> -Atlanta Girl- <s> My wife and me stayed in the Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August in a weekend visit to Chicago . <s> The hotel is located in the 20 W Kinzie St ;  in the well-known River North District . <s> We got what the hotel promised :  gentle staff ;  a luxury room with a breathtaking view ;  magnificent meals and a select wine . <s> I also used its well-equipped gymnasium . <s> We paid  $ 586 with taxes for two nights . <s> I think it was a good price ;  taking in account the excellent conditions we got there . <s> I would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago . <s> The Swissotel Chicago hotel aspires to be a tourist's paradise ;  a hotel so grand and luxurious that you'd rather stay than return home at the end of your trip . <s> But is it really as magnificent as suggested ? <s> True ;  you can get a massage ;  the rooms have flat screen T . V . s and iPod docks ;  heck ;  there's even a gym . <s> But the truth is ;  you're really paying much more for a few things you don't really need . <s> The Swissotel attempts to lure you in with their illusions of grandeur ;  when really ;  all you're getting is a Holiday Inn style room with fancy wallpaper and the ability to play tunes from your mp3 player . <s> Overpriced dining options are available at the Palm Restaurant . <s> They claim to serve excellent lobster ;  yet what I ordered was the size of a craw fish ;  and left the taste of a burnt fifty dollar bill in my mouth . <s> This hotel hides behind a velvet curtain ;  hoping their facade won't be revealed . <s> On my recent weekend stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel ;  i was very disappointed . <s> I chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area . <s> From the look of the website ;  my expectations were above average . <s> I felt the website led one to believe it was upscale . <s> Upon my arrival ;  i checked in . <s> I was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room . <s> As i was settling into the room ;  I began to notice a general lack of cleanliness . <s> I noticed spiderwebs in corners ;  and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom . <s> Also ;  it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room ;  however ;  it did not work and I had to call down for them to bring a replacement . <s> I ;  as a guest should not have had to call down ;  these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in . <s> I found the restaurants on site to be crowded ;  loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal . <s> I did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items . <s> Overall ;  my experience was not good and the next time I am in the area ;  I will chose another hotel for my stay . <s> We just returned from a girls shopping  / sight-seeing trip . The Palmer House was like home away from home . The hotel is undergoing renovations but we did not notice any inconveniences or hear any noise from the work . The lobby was breathtaking ;  all dressed up for Christmas . The staff from check-in to housekeeping was very welcoming and friendly . Our room was updated with two beds and two separate baths which was great for everyone to have their own personal space . I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone . Chicago is a great town . <s> My husband and I stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in Chicago for our anniversary . <s> The hotel was beautiful and luxurious as one would expect from a Hilton brand hotel in a major city . <s> The service was excellent with check-in and check-out going smoothly . <s> The location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to attend the theater ;  visit the Lincoln Park zoo and picnic by the lake . <s> All of these were very close to our hotel . <s> The price was reasonable for the location and luxurious accommodations . <s> We also enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge . <s> Highly recommend . <s> Great location - right on the Chicago River - away from the other skyscraper hotels - our room was good size ;  very clean and with a nice river view - Overall ;  a great staff - in particular I would like to point out Christy Morgan - Chief Experience Officer and Paula Fortney - Concierge for their assistance in making this stay a memorable one -  ( in the interests of full disclosure ;  we stayed here on our AMEX - Starwood points )  <s> Intercontinental Chicago - This place is OK ;  just OK !  ! <s> I have stayed at Intercontinental Chicago more than once but after my recent visit last month ;  I think it has lost its 4 and a half star quality . <s> The rooms are spacious but they looked outdated . <s> The wallpaper was old and the bathroom was particularly below standards . <s> The internet was poor especially at my floor and there was no use of complaining ! <s> Its location is still convenient but the charm is gone . <s> I will try out other options for my next trip . <s> This was a great hotel ;  one of the nicest that we have stayed in a long time . <s> My wife was absolutely thrilled with the staff and we couldn't believe the KimptonKids program at the site . <s> We will be back next time we stop in town . <s> We cannot think of a better place to stay . <s> This hotel is great ! <s> I love its interior design of the room . <s> Customer service is excellent ! <s> And its gym and spa are gorgeous . <s> If you need to go to Chicago ;  this hotel would be your best choice ! <s> You can also check its website for the special offer ;  I found a great deal on it ! <s> This hotel is a shambles-furniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed ;  nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the so-called amenities . <s> The  " fitness center "  is an oversized closet ! <s> We were appalled during our stay ! <s> Truly anticipated  " warm ;  Irish hospitality "  and short of a barman ;  no one was Irish ;  warm or hospitable ! <s> Manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request . <s> Her manager  (  ? <s>  )  refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us . <s> Room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 7 : 30am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate . <s> To call this a Red Roof Inn would be an insult to RRI ! <s> The manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all . <s> The only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the trade-off . <s> This hotel is rather far from the airport and in traffic it took almost 2 hours to get there . <s> By that time ;  I was so tired I was just ready to check in to my room . <s> I stood in line forever as there was only one person working at the front desk . <s> That was only the beginning . <s> It was very noisy outside from people constantly walking around . <s> I guess it's because they're located in the middle of the downtown area ;  but they could at least make the walls thicker . <s> I don't want to hear everything going on in my neighbor's room . <s> The bathroom was not very clean and one of the towels had a hole in it . <s> The toilet ran all night which kept me up along with all the people on the street . <s> The restaurant food was horrible and I would rather buy food from a street vendor than to pay the ridiculously high price they charged for a burger . <s> Overall ;  I was very disappointed with my stay at the Conrad Chicago . <s> My wife and I frequently stay downtown for a night in the city . <s> We have been to many hotels in the downtown Chicago area . <s> My opinion of the Swissotel - spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience . <s> The Swissotel has a very 'cold' atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable . <s> The room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average . <s> The view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel . <s> Other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more . <s> Our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 8 : 00a which woke us up . <s> We called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk . <s> We also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel . <s> They said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register . <s> He didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment . <s> Overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment . <s> Spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off Michigan avenue for real top notch service . <s> Anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area . <s> While the hotel certainly seems to look beautiful ;  the hotel is actually far from it . <s> Even booking a room online was rather difficult ;  and i wasn't able to reach a representative upon calling any of the contact numbers . <s> In general coming here is a bad decision despite how it looks ;  its a mistake i wont make again and you shouldn't either . <s> great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE ! <s> Wonderful lobby ! <s> AND THAT'S IT ! <s> The room was old in style and furnitures ;  the tv was from the other century ;  no minibar ;  no wireless internet ;  no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room ;  those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections . <s> small room ;  small bathroom ;  rude service room . <s> they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars . <s> Robbery in the business center ;  0 ; 59 cents a MINUTE for internet connection ;  you have to pay to use word ;  or excel . <s> NEVER AGAIN ! <s> This was our third trip to Chicago this year  ( we LOVE the city ! <s>  )  - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel . <s> Swissotel was definitely our favourite . <s> When we come back in July to see the play  "  Wicked "  for the second time ;  we will be again at Swissotel . <s> No more need to try other hotels ! <s> The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile . <s> The room was spotless and quiet ;  the view amazing and those elevators were so fast . <s> Comfortable beds ;  friendly service ;  not as many noisy sirens ! <s> We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed ! <s> This was the best anniversary ever . <s> We would recommend Swissotel to everyone ! <s> I stayed at the Knickerbocker Hotel the last time I visited Chicago . <s> I lived in Illinois during college ;  and as I was on a college budget ;  most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown . <s> For my visit back ;  I decided I would treat myself to a nicer stay than I was used to ;  so I booked a room at the Knickerbocker . <s> Everything looked nice when I got there ;  but for the price I paid ;  I was really expecting something far above and beyond what I got . <s> Maybe I wasn't dressed right ;  or didn't carry the right luggage ;  but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when I checked in . <s> Shouldn't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome ? <s> When I stayed at the cheap hotels in college ;  the front desk employees were always friendly when I checked in and out ;  and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city . <s> Here ;  I didn't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because I didn't want to deal with the eye rolling and  " too important to be bothered "  attitude I got when I checked in . <s> I guess the location was more convenient than the hotels I used to visit ;  but I really thought that part of the money I was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience . <s> Look ;  obviously I can afford to stay at your hotel ;  I already booked and paid for the room . <s> Even if customer service isn't your number one goal ;  making money should be pretty high up on the list ;  and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isn't a very good way to secure return business . <s> I doubt I'll stay here again . <s> Recently returned from a two-night stay at Ambassador East Hotel . <s> Was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in Chicago . <s> Mission was accomplished . <s> If you would like a quiet ;  comfortable hotel in a great area - this is it . <s> While some of the furnishings show some signs of their age ;  it does not detract from the elegant style of the rooms and adds to the comfortable and home-like feeling . <s> Found staff to be friendly and helpful . <s> We will be return guests many times in the future for sure . <s> My son  &  I joined my husband on a work trip . <s> We planned to swim while he was working . <s> We overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in . <s> Though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm . <s> We gave up  &  went out for the evening . <s> We had a very noisy sleepless night . <s> We weren't facing MI ave ;  but still heard sirens and I'm not sure what the other noise was ;  but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night . <s> I called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open ;  so my  ( very excited )  son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction . <s> Upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crew's actions  &  on my insistence she said she'd look into it . <s> A gentleman called back an hour later  &  said the pool should open at 5pm ... it was 9am . <s> It is now 6pm  &  we still haven't even seen the pool . <s> We check out tomorrow . <s> We passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to  " swim in Chicago . <s>  "  Needless to say we are VERY disappointed . <s> I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown ;  and found it lacking in the quality of their service . <s> The rooms are nice and well furnished ;  but the service lacks in some areas . <s> Some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access ;  cardio-fitness and indoor pool ;  grocery shopping service and coffee ;  tea ;  hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby's 24 hour convenience shop . <s> However the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times ;  the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned . <s> The grocery shopping service was alright ;  although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality . <s> Rating this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5 ;  I would give it a 3 at best . <s> While the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside ;  my experience went downhill once I walked in . <s> The lighting is very poor ;  which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere . <s> The mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle . <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay . <s> I definitely would not stay here again . <s> Wow ! <s> I have been to many hotels as a business man ;  and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels . <s> But wow ;  this hotel was great . <s> The staff was prompt ;  the room was extremely clean ;  and everything just ran like a well-oiled machine . <s> I was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things . <s> Usually I have to pay 5 $  for a stupid toothbrush ;  but not here ! <s> I really enjoyed staying at InterContintental . <s> I was very worried about the Chicago area's reputation of bad hotels ;  but this turned out just great . <s> Next time my boss flies me out to Chicago ;  I know where I am staying ! <s> Our suite at the Knickerbocker are quite nice ;  but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal . <s> First ;  a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present . <s> Not a tremendous problem ;  but when the young woman at the front desk replied  " What do you want me to do about it "  with the tone of a flippant teenager ;  I began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff . <s> Fast forward to this evening . <s> Following a lovely meal off the premises ;  we chose to turn in a bit early at 11 : 30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions ;  the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room . <s> Acting prudently and with restraint ;  we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs ;  but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response . <s> Sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel ;  and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume . <s> On one hand I appreciated his honesty ;  but on the other ;  I truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property . <s> Since we're out of options for the evening ;  we've decided to stay up and try to watch TV for the time being ;  but given the circumstances ;  the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession . <s> Also ;  I was alarmed to learn that while I slept the prior night ;  a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property . <s> This wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels ;  the Knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby . <s> Would I stay here again ? <s> Maybe on a dare ;  or if someone else was footing the bill . <s> Yet I've had better experiences in road side motels ;  and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests ;  and more importantly simple common sense . <s> HiltonChicago - Incredibly overpriced . <s> The rooms were nice and the architecture of the building itself was really pretty ;  and it's really close to downtown ;  but not worth shelling out the extra bucks . <s> Didn't even include breakfast  --  you had to pay for an upgrade to get  " complimentary "  breakfast  ( it did look good though ;  lots of fresh fruit . <s>  )  Front desk people also seemed a little snooty . <s> The hotel is in a good location . <s> It is very contemporary in decoration . <s> Beautiful flowers in lobby . <s> The room service was very good . <s> Concierge services were also very good . <s> We were treated well . <s> The shower water pressure was very poor . <s> Also ;  at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us ;  which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually prepaid . <s> It was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel . <s> Bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizers / food . <s> read more <s> The Amalfi Hotel advertises itself as a  " luxury boutique hotel "  and as such I expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average . <s> Unfortunately ;  this was not the case . <s> The room I booked was not clean ;  in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest . <s> There was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned . <s> In addition ;  although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room ;  I could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke . <s> I will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants ;  sites and shops all within walking distance . <s> However ;  given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room ;  I would not stay at the Amalfi Hotel again . <s> My family and I vacation in Chicago and stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel . <s> Upon our arrival we were greeted happily and the kids received FREE bagpacks for their stay which they loved . <s> The staff was great and always greeted us as we walked in and out of the hotel . <s> They even remembered our names ! <s> The location of the hotel was amazing ;  right on the Magnificent Mile . <s> We really enjoyed our stay and the kids loved the indoor pool . <s> I would definitely stay there again if I have the chance and would recommend it to anyone I know going to the Chicago area . <s> I work for a software marketing firm ;  and that job requires me to travel at least 100 days per year . <s> I spend a large amount of time in hotels . <s> I normally don't write reviews for hotels ;  but the Homewood Suites by Hilton were above and beyond . <s> Let's start where it matters :  the rooms . <s> They are top notch . <s> There's nothing better than walking in to a clean ;  beautiful rooms after a long day of travel . <s> The beds are among the best I've ever slept in in hotels . <s> The rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home . <s> The price :  Low . <s> I looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels ;  and everything else was at least 10 %  more expensive . <s> But you don't get what you pay for here . <s> You get much more than that ! <s> The location :  Couldn't be better . <s> You want to go to a world class restaurant ? <s> That's within walking distance . <s> You want a great shopping experience ? <s> Again ;  walking distance . <s> Anything else you want ? <s> Chances are ;  it's within walking distance . <s> Overall ;  one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in . <s> I was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Allegro . <s> The front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window . <s> After giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet . <s> This came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began . <s> After waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested . <s> We were informed that they were  " only requests "  and not a guarantee . <s> Room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed . <s> When we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted . <s> The food took an eternity to reach the room and the order wasn't exactly right either . <s> This is not the kind of service I expected from an upscale hotel . <s> I recently had a horrible stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago . <s> When I first arrived I was impressed with the architecture and location ;  but things went downhill in a hurry . <s> The front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though I had reserved a room with two queen beds ;  they told me that  " only king bed rooms were available at the time "  ;  and there was nothing they could do about it . <s> The room itself was a nightmare . <s> It smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement . <s> There was also a huge problem with my television ;  in that it would automatically turn itself off every 15 minutes or so . <s> I complained about these problems ;  but very little was done . <s> The hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets ;  but the quality was only marginally improved . <s> Overall I was very disappointed with my stay at the InterContinental Hotel in Chicago . <s> From the pictures I had seen online I had expected a wonderful hotel ;  but what I actually got was on par with what you would typically find at a rundown interstate motel . <s> The room looked like a country club prison cell . <s> Flat paint on all walls ;  doors ;  trims ;  not especially clean . <s> A platform bed and a long shelf / desk with an iron chair . <s> No amenities ;  no homey touches ;  nothing on the walls . <s> No room service ;  no gym ;  no concierge . <s> The air conditioner clunked off and on all night . <s> On the plus side ;  the bedding was nice and there was a large screen TV . <s> Don't waste your money . <s> DO NOT STAY HERE !  ! <s> My wife and I were visiting family in Chicago and decided to stay at the James . <s> We had stayed at the James in New York happily so we came in with good expectations . <s> What a mistake . <s> Our room looked nothing like the ones pictured on the website . <s> The bathroom was dirty and the bedding and furniture were disheveled . <s> There was also a musty odor to the room . <s> When we called the front desk to complain they were quite rude . <s> We ended up leaving and staying in a different hotel for the duration of our stay . <s> Upon first inspection ;  Sofitel Chicago Water Tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown Chicago ;  but appearances can certainly be deceiving . <s> Best summed up ;  Sofitel is nothing more than a fancy Holiday Inn . <s> It certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain ;  even if it is an international one . <s> The customer service is poor unless you look like you have  $ 50 to tip someone . <s> The furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from Ikea . <s> The rooms are dirty when you first walk in ;  the air feels stale ;  and the views are certainly all they're cracked up to be . <s> None of this is worth a  " luxury "  price or even worthy of a  " luxury "  name . <s> I will certainly not be staying here again . <s> I reserved the  " Rock star "  suite for my boyfriend's birthday months and months in advanced . <s> When we arrived at the Hotel Monaco ;  they told us that they doubled booked the room . <s> This was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available . <s> They tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant - which we didn't even use . <s> I felt we were taken advantage of because we were young . <s> The doorman didn't make us feel any better when he told us that it wasn't the first time they did this for the  " rock star "  suite . <s> However ;  the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake I ordered . <s> If it wasn't for the room confusion - It would have been a wonderful stay . <s> The James Hotel in Chicago was a huge let down . <s> I was expecting a truly spectacular experience . <s> On the website it appears to be an absolutely fabulous state of the art hotel . <s> Well ;  my family's bad experience started right when we walked in the door . <s> It turns out the room we had reserved had been given to someone else ;  and the man at the front desk was extremely rude . <s> We had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us . <s> The room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they weren't already in the room . <s> The one thing that was good about the place was the fabulous gym . <s> All in all ;  I feel that we paid way too much for what we got . <s> Next time I will look to stay somewhere else . <s> While overall a decent property ;  the incident I had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel . <s> I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco for five nights ;  checking out on Monday ;  March 19th . <s> Shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet ;  my partner and I noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in . <s> We had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay . <s> I called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at Park One  ( their valet company )  who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival ;  and was scraped upon departure from the garage . <s> The garage manager ;  Mike Yunan ;  didn't call back until I had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel ;  Marco Scherer . <s> When he finally got back to me ;  the garage manager stated that he would file an  " incident report "  and claim with his insurance company ;  Travelers ;  which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability ;  nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage ;  which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in ;  but was at check-out . <s> Their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location ;  contradicting the garage manager . <s> In the end ;  this Kimpton InTouch guest got stuck with a  $ 1 ; 000 bill for parking at this Kimpton property :  an almost  $ 500 paint scrape on top of a  $ 48 / per day parking fee ;  rental car expenses ;  several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue ;  and one gigantic headache . <s> In the end ;  do NOT trust the valets or staff at this hotel ;  and take your business elsewhere if at all possible . <s> I recently stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel and I could not be more pleased . <s> The hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern ;  stylish rooms . <s> The rooms are something truly special with huge ;  soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt . <s> The bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower / tub . <s> If that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32 "  LCD TV that displays TV in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system . <s> When you finally make it out of your room ;  down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant . <s> It is called Cafe des Architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic French techniques . <s> Their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the Magnificent mile . <s> A full dinner including appetizer ;  main course ;  and dessert can be had for  $ 45 ;  amazing . <s> If you are looking for a modern ;  urban ;  chic hotel in Chicago then look no further ;  the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel is your only real choice . <s> The service was reasonably well ... they seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily . <s> The location was fine being that it was central to the city but I found out that it was also a tremendous drawback . <s> It was interesting that the survey I took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response  " Quiet "  . <s> My visit was anything but ;  mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor ;  facing the street . <s> I awoke at 4 a . m .  and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the L train that sounded as though it was just outside my window . <s> Not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting . <s> At check-out when I informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said ;   "  Ah ;  city noise . <s>  "  <s> The Omni Chicago is hands down ;  the best hotel in my opinion in the chicago area . <s> I am a neat freak but here you need not worry about cleanliness as they are the best at keeping the rooms tidy . <s> Our check in was easy and fast and the staff at the hotel was very courteous and friendly . <s> I forgot my hair dryer but thankfully ;  one of the many perks at this hotel ;  they provide one for you in your room ! <s> That's a small benefit compared to the lucious pool and dreamy massages they offer ! <s> I have never had a massage like that before ! <s> My favortie thing about the Omni is the high speed wireless internet that is available to all guests . <s> I am able to do my work online in all areas of the hotel which saved me a lot of time as I was not at my office but still had a lot of work to get done . <s> I also LOVED the TV they provide in the room . <s> A big plasma with a beautiful ;  crisp picture ! <s> I don't even have that at home ! <s> Needless to say ;  I spent almost all night lounging in the comfortable bed watching movies only to fall asleep and wake up to the newspaper delivered to my hotel door in the morning ! <s> I will be coming back to the Omni on my next trip to Chicago . <s> That's a promise . <s> My fiancee and I were looking for a modern ;  upscale venue for our wedding reception . <s> We have found the perfect location at The James . <s> From the ballroom to the personal attention to detail ;  each step was handled with care . <s> Now that we have locked in our date ;  we are more excited than ever . <s> Thank you staff at The James for making our day even more special ! <s> The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy . <s> The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding ;  making it dark . <s> They charge a lot for internet hook up ;  wifi is not included . <s> The staff was very slow ;  I am assuming they were all new . <s> They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby . <s> The room was set up weird ;  the bathroom opened facing the bed ;  rather than the hall as most do . <s> Room temp was hard to control ;  even though they had a digital thermostat . <s> Overall I was very disappointed ;  had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels . <s> In the 100 degree heat of a Chicago summer ;  it sucks if your air conditioner does not work . <s> After 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue I was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room . <s> I requested a room change and a not so polite ;  unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity . <s> Maybe a manager could help me in the morning . <s> The next day went by and no call was received . <s> At 7pm ;  I called the front desk . <s> No one was aware of my problem . <s> Approximately 45 minutes later ;  a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available . <s> I accepted it was glee . <s> Anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer . <s> I was paritally correct . <s> The bathroom door of the new room did not close . <s> Thank god my boyfriend and I are past the shy part of the relationship . <s> As for room 1618 ;  I believe I was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner . <s> What's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room . <s> And did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna ! <s> This hotel need a major overhaul !  ! <s> This is a superb hotel . <s> The rooms are huge ;  including a luxurious bathroom . <s> It is clean and service is first rate . <s> Breakfast was excellent  ( and complimentary for Hilton Honors members )  . <s> Hotel is in a good location ;  and is connected to a mall ;  which I imagine would be a great asset in the Chicago winter . <s> Next time I go to Chicago ;  I will stay here for sure . <s> Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park - My husband and I just returned from Chicago and had a nice trip ;  but this was not because of the Fairmont Hotel we stayed at . <s> When we tried to check-in our reservation was not in their system ;  and once they finally found us a room it looked out on to an alley . <s> This is definitely not the type of experience I normally associate with an expensive hotel like the Fairmont . <s> I will definitely be staying at a different hotel next time I go to Chicago . <s> I stayed at the Omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown Chicago hotel . <s> I was completely impressed by the service ;  all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding . <s> I checked in quite early  ( no problem )  and was efficiently checked in . <s> My room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener  ( the ONLY negative from the entire stay )  ;  which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows . <s> I don't generally require much during my hotel stays ;  but suffice to say the doorman ;  housekeeping ;  the night manager and bartender at 676 ;  the day waiter at 676 ;  and the concierge were amazing - I never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything . <s> The room was very comfy and the amenities were superior . <s> One very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex / coffee paraphernalia . <s> One wastebasket would make all the difference . <s> All that said - what a great hotel !  ! <s> Thanks ;  Omni - I had a great stay ! <s> Just back from a business trip . <s> The Homewood is in a great location just off the Magnificent Mile ;  includes a great breakfast ;  heavy hors d'ouevres for dinner with beer and all for a pre-paid rate of  $ 129 . <s> Without a doubt the best value in Chicago for a long ;  long time . <s> As a regular visitor to Chicago and a freuent guest at the Ambassador East ;  I was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit . <s> Room service has been eliminated despite the renowned Pump Room being located in the hotel ;  there was no in-room directory ;  the carpet was torn and stained ;  no phone book ;  the refigerator and honor bar had been removed ;  and the room was so small I had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire . <s> I asked the desk clerk about larger rooms ;  and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms - which is untrue ;  as there are several larger room types . <s> He didn't even offer to check availablity of other rooms ! <s> In talking with the consierge ;  she blamed everything on upcoming renovations - which the hotel has been promising for more than two years . <s> All in all ;  a very disappointing ;  and expensive ;  experience . <s> Do you want to stay in a sleek modern hotel that gives you all of the amenities to conduct your business ? <s> Then the James Hotel in Chicago is the place for you . <s> Superb clean lines and sophistication welcomes you on first sight . <s> Followed by spacious rooms ;  luxurious linens ;  and all-natural Kiehl's body shampoos and lotions . <s> I absolutely loved my stay at the James Hotel in downtown Chicago . <s> The bathrooms have raised sinks ;  and all of the luxurious amenities you would want . <s> I absolutely loved the natural wood feel mingled with a modern touch . <s> I felt at home in a very clean and modern atmosphere . <s> I definitely would stay again ;  and plan to stay at the James in New York as well <s> I had my wedding ceremony and reception at the Sofitel . <s> It seems as though I had the same experience as  " Judy L .  "  I read her review and thought  " that's exactly what happened to me ! <s>  "  Here's what happened :  The good news :  The actual event was great . <s> Most notably ;  the food was absolutely incredible ;  I think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food . <s> The same goes for the cake ;  which was made by Take the Cake . <s> The service by the waiters and other staff was also very good . <s> The bad news :  Michelle ;  the Director of Catering ;  honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare . <s> While we were negotiating the contract ;  she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls ;  after the contract was signed ;  it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered ;  to schedule the tasting ;  etc . <s> She frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email ;  and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until I called her a second or third time . <s> I assumed things would get better within the month -- or even the week -- prior to my wedding ;  but they actually got even worse . <s> Michelle just could not get it together ;  and if it weren't for my wedding coordinator's assistance in forcing her to finally get things right ;  I don't know what would have happened . <s> Thus ;  if it weren't for Michelle's inability to do her job ;  I would have had a great experience . <s> But ;  as it is ;  when I think back about my experience with the Sofitel ;  I unfortunately have very negative thoughts . <s> And that's incredibly disappointing ;  considering it was a major part of the best night of my life . <s> Having recently been in Chicago for business and based on proximity and aesthetics ;  I decided to reserve a room at the Conrad Hotel in Chicago and I couldn't have been more delighted with every aspect of my two-night stay . <s> Every conceivable amenity is available from the 42 "  plasma flat-screen to both wired and wireless internet connections available I was able to stay in constant contact with the office all while in the enviable lap of luxury . <s> My room was not only comfortable and clean ;  but warm and inviting just as if it were home away from home . <s> If you're in the Chicago area ;  reserve a room at the Conrad Hotels and Resorts and you will not be disappointed . <s> I recently traveled up to Chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in downtown . <s> The location was perfect as it gave me easy access to Michigan Avenue and the conference center where I was doing business . <s> My hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere . <s> I ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so I was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs . <s> The food was extremely good and I really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat . <s> I had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress . <s> I woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel . <s> They had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well . <s> After shower I headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests . <s> The breakfast was delicious and started my day out right . <s> After my business stuff was over I really got out and enjoyed Chicago . <s> I met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well . <s> When I go back to Chicago I will definitely stay at the Sofitel again . <s> We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights ; a wonderful place . Room was on the 29th floor ; absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview . Breakfast perfect and service really good . People were always helpful . It's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop ; but in front of the hotel there are buses  ( number6 ) waiting there next turn ; not a real bus stop ; but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus . Next time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel . <s> The Affinia Chicago is a wonderful place to stay ;  my husband and I stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time . <s> The rooms were very well organized and comfortable ;  the staff there are very friendly ;  and the food there is more then amazing . <s> we are defiantly going back next year . <s> We enjoyed the Hotel Monaco . <s> Great location for walking and beautiful rooms . <s> The staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests . <s> Will definitely stay there again ! <s> We reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay . <s> After checking in and unpacking ;  we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed  ( supposedly during renovation )  . <s> The front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room . <s> Colleen ;  one of the managers ;  was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem . <s> We ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed . <s> We never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently  " absent from the hotel "  during most of our stay . <s> We stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence . <s> We had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology . <s> The lack of training of the staff was clearly evident ;  as was the cavalier attitude of the management . <s> sofitel-chicago-water-tower - Last week ;  I went on a trip to Chicago and stayed at the hotel for two nights . <s> We chose here mainly because its location in downtown with easy access to public transports  ( bus ;  subway ;  airport )  making it an ideal base for exploring Chicago . <s> Our room is not huge but has sufficient space and has nice and cozy decorations . <s> The bathroom is a lot larger than any of us would have imagined and is equipped with branded soap and shampoo . <s> The staffs are efficient and professional yet friendly . <s> The front desk greeted us with smile ;  the conceirge is very knowledgable of the area and gave us some insightful advice to improve our plan . <s> This is very helpful if it is your first time here . <s> We did not have a chance to try the restaurant though which is a pity because we really like one of the restaurant's interiors with cozy big red sofa and high ceiling in addition to the food . <s> Maybe we will try that the next time . <s> All in all ;  we had a pleasant stay at this hotel and will come back next time . <s> I had a great time here ! <s> It is centerally located in Chicago so walking around is so easy and pleasent . <s> The staff was amazing and very helpful ! <s> Parking was a bit steep ;  but to be expected . <s> The room was very nice and the bed and linens were very confortable . <s> The yoga mat rental was wonderful as well ! <s> Wonderful and relaxing experience overall . <s> Not one of my better experiences ;  When I first arrived at the hotel and tried to get my room key it was discovered that they were fresh out of keys . <s> I had to wait half an hour while someone ran out to get more keys . <s> It wouldn't have been as bad but the lobby looked to be in slight disrepair . <s> When I finally got to the room I found the burnt out light bulb and an unmade bed . <s> The room was an ok size for one person but any more than that and it would probably get a bit crowded . <s> But the view from the window was amazing ;  and it took away some of the bad for me . <s> Overall ;  it just felt like the owners of the hotel stopped caring ;  maintenance took four or so hours to finally come fix the light . <s> I didn't even get housekeeping my entire stay there . <s> I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone in the area ;  hopefully it will make them get their act together . <s> We have stayed at several high end places in Chicago and this is still our favorite . <s> Location is superb ;  staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying . <s> Cornell ;  at the front desk ;  is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge . <s> We love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program ;  high speed internet is gratis ;  as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing . <s> Bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains ! <s> We have never had a bad stay at this hotel . <s> We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids . <s> We reserved the  " Family Adventurer with Paul Frank "  . <s> It's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium . <s> We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes ;  which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children's Museum . <s> My kids had a ball . <s> We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored . <s> All in all ;  a great weekend where my kids were the focus . <s> The adults certainly weren't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning . <s> I recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago . <s> Although I visit this fun city quite often ;  I was somewhat disappointed with the service and noise in a hotel that is called  " luxury boutique "  . <s> To begin with ;  our  " Experience Designer "  was somewhat put-offish and cool . <s> She did not really have a grasp of all the wonderful things to do in Chicago . <s> Although she did look up some attractions ;  it seems like she may have recently arrived from LA . <s> As far as the room ;  it was indeed luxury and had nice lighting and decoration . <s> However ;  the noise from the adjoining room was unbelievable and kept us up all night . <s> Most likely ;  the walls are very thin ;  and construction is not the greatest . <s> Who wants to hear the neighbors ;  especially when they are honeymooners or whatever ! <s> So we probably will not stay there again . <s> The location is great ;  the cocktails fine ;  the luxury is there ;  but other than that ;  it is the pits . <s> Weary Traveler ;  San Francisco <s> I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower . <s> My husband and I had planned a trip to Chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary . <s> We had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from California so they could have time with their grandchildren . <s> My husband and I had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to Iraq the week after we got married . <s> Everyone was so excited ! <s> Mark and I had reservations for one of the junior suites . <s> We hadn't gone to Chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered . <s> Unfortunately ;  when we got to our room ;  the view was disappointing . <s> We had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one ;  but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there . <s> I am asthmatic and became very ill .  We asked to be moved to another room ;  but were told there were no other rooms  ( even downgrades )  available . <s> Nothing was done to try to make up for this . <s> Because of my health ;  my husband and I checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend . <s> This is not how I had imagined spending such a special time . <s> Now ;  when I think of my 10th anniversary ;  I will always have this memory to tarnish it . <s> I stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town . <s> It was a little pricey ;  but definitely worth it ! <s> The staff was super friendly ;  the pool was clean and well-maintained ;  and they even had a really good veggie burger in the restaurant downstairs  ( I'm a vegetarian )  . <s> Plus ;  I paid for a room with a lake view and it was gorgeous . <s> I would definitely recommend . <s> We needed an extra night in Chicago after a gratus stay at The Penninsula and won a SkyAuction bid for The James @  $ 203 . <s> This is one of the nicest hotels that I've ever stayed in . <s> Bathroom aside ;  we felt it equalled The Penninsula in comfort and level of service . <s> I echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime I'm in town . <s> My husband and I loved this hotel . <s> The staff were friendly ;  the food on the room service menu was a reasonable price ;  and we got an extra  ( free )  coffeepot in our room immediately when we asked for it . <s> Highly recommended ! <s> Spent three nights in Chicago at this property . <s> First of all ;  I have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the Magnificent Mile close to terrific restaurants ;  the Art Institute and Orchestra Hall . <s> The hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing . <s> The rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired . <s> This property needs to be renovated . <s> Some observations :  The junior suite I had was laid out strangely . <s> A small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom . <s> The mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy . <s> While descending in the elevator one morning ;  it started shaking so violently that I could barely stand up . <s> It stopped on the 11th floor and I was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down . <s>  ( This experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness ! <s>  )  Reports from my group were of sinks stopped up ;  exposed bolts in rooms ;  and generally things not working . <s> Now the good news - the staff is terrific . <s> They make you feel welcome ;  are personable ;  have their own personalities ;  great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help . <s> I wish they had a better property to work in . <s> Omni Chicago Hotel - Last monday my wife and I got back from a stay at the Omni in Chicago . <s> This is a decent hotel ;  but I won't be choosing it again for our stays in Chicago  ( usually visiting family )  . <s> The room has plenty of space ;  easy furniture to relax in ;  good layout ;  and is generally well put together and comfortable . <s> The faults were more centered around service . <s> We had to wait for a half hour on arrival just to check in ;  and ;  while I understand they have other customers ;  I just got off a plane and just want to relax . <s> That by itself I wouldn't have minded - but wait ;  there's more . <s> We ordered room service the next day  ( day 2 of the 3 day onslaught )  ;  not only did it take us a couple tries for the staff to get our order right ;  but then it took a while too ! <s> We were waiting like ..  an hour and a half ;  and it was just for a pasta dish and a burger ;  it's not like we ordered a 3 course meal with a salmonentree and a creme brulee for dessert . <s> Not only did we have to wait ;  the staff wasn't apologetic when they did arrive ;  and ;  finally ;  we weren't impressed with the food itself either . <s> To be fair ;  it was O . K . <s> but I had looked around online and we had really expected more . <s> The website seemed appealing ;  and then I got live chat service on the website ;  which I was really impressed with ;  but I am disillusioned . <s> In fairness to the Omni ;  it was quiet ;  and a nice place for an adult couple . <s> There weren't many if any families ;  and they were all well behaved ;  so we did get to relax and unwind in peace . <s> Given the price and caliber of this hotel ;  we just expected better people interactions . <s> We got a spanking deal at this hotel for  $ 99 a night . <s> It's in a good location to the Loop . <s> Excellent transportation options abound . <s> My gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a  " crappy "  room . <s> It overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us . <s> The toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor . <s> Other than that ;  if I needed to stay in the Loop again for something and I knew I wasn't going to be put in a undesirable room ;  I would stay here again . <s> The name  " Hard Rock "  might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here . <s> The website alludes to musicians and parties but if you're looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the Hard Rock falls short . <s> The hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this . <s> The service is mediocre and the rooms aren't clean . <s> I stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in Chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun ;  exciting romance . <s> I should have picked somewhere else . <s> Save your money . <s> While travelling for business I had my family join me and we stayed at the Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park . <s> It is breathtakingly beautiful and plush . <s> The rates for rooms ;  though not the cheapest choice are quite reasonable for such fabulous amenities . <s> The room decor is elegant modern and my wife says the spa is divine ! <s> Guests of this hotel are able to live in luxury - every room is equipped with complementary coffee ;  access to high speed internet ;  bathrobes ;  and 42 inch flat screen televisions . <s> Enjoy the gorgeous city views and live the good life at the Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park . <s> Problems started when I booked the InterContinental Chicago online at the hotel's site ;  and got a server error . <s> Somehow I managed to get my reservation ;  and wish I had looked elsewhere on this great Chicago street ;  filled with plenty of other options . <s> The server errors continued at check in and didn't let up . <s> I was on a holiday weekend ;  but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers ;  and I had trouble getting served . <s> The hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort . <s> The health facilities are also just too big ;  so noisy and crowded . <s> And Internet access was  $ 18 a day ;  kind of surprising when I can go around the corner to a Starbucks ! <s> Next time ;  I'll pick a more intimate place nearby -- without so many  " server errors "  . <s> The InterContinental hotel is truly a hidden treasure . <s> Nestled deep in sky scraping steel epicenter of downtown Chicago ;  the hotel is a taste of both modern day luxury and old time charm . <s> From the tiled indoor pool surrounded by high Romanesque arching ceilings to the rich mahogany furniture and lace curtains in the suites ;  the InterContinental was built to satisfy the taste of even the most hardened traveler . <s> Book well in advance as it is one of the most sought after retreats in all of Chicago . <s> We chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds . <s> We anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel ;  than some of the other larger high rise hotels . <s> We did not experience very good service at the Talbott Hotel . <s> When we checked Irena seemed very robotic and aloof . <s> The front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious . <s> The lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door . <s> Each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff ;  just a blank stare and gaze . <s> The front desk staff was chilly and stiff ;  no greetings ;  no smiles and no personality . <s> They had difficulty answering simple questions or requests . <s> On the other hand the bellman Perry was great . <s> He was sociable and very service oriented . <s> He was aware of what is going on in the area . <s> He recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area ;  and where to eat in the neighborhood . <s> He is authentic and he even asked us upon our return  " how was that restaurant ? <s>  "  Tim the concierge was also supportive . <s> He gave us 10 %  discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores . <s> We had the largest suite . <s> We requested a rollaway  ( extra charge )  when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10PM . <s> When the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed . <s> What made our Talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned . <s> We were out of our room from 8AM and when we returned to our room at 4PM the rooms had not been cleaned . <s> We called the front desk to ask to send someone . <s> The maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening . <s> The room itself was pleasant . <s> It did have a moldy smell and some Frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much . <s> We were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin . <s> We really liked staying in this area of Chicago but expected first rate service . <s> The service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel . <s> If you want the downtown experience of a lifetime ;  with historical living that will bring you back to Chicago in the early 1900's look no further ;  the dining experience is as comfortable as the stay ;  service is immaculate ;  and just as you think things couldn't get any better ;  you are only a walk away from one of the most exciting cities in America :  Chicago with fine dining and a late night rendezvous as exciting as the nightlife ;  you are sure to have your excitement whims met ;  and walk away with the memory of a lifetime . <s> Believe me I did . <s> Valued Customer ;  Josh <s> Omni Chicago Hotel - Just got back from a 2 night stay at the Omniâ€¦ great hotel . <s> Obviously ;  as a 5 star hotel ;  it's nice . <s> I arrived at 4 : 00pm my first day and was all ready to go right when I showed up  ( I had pre-booked and paid )  . <s> I was helped up to my room - erâ€¦ suite  ( should and could only be described as a suite )  - number 535 ;  with my bagsâ€¦ it was nice to get the assistance right off the bat when I had been traveling . <s> The room was picture perfect ;  in all honesty a little too perfect - felt like I had walked into a commercialâ€¦ kind of prevents you from feeling like you can make yourself at home ;  don't want to mess anything up . <s> I say too perfect as the like lighting and color choices for furnishings were like ;  formalâ€¦ professional ;  not entirely welcoming . <s> That said the furniture and bed was comfortable ;  and the room offers anything you need ;  so once you get passed the worrying keeping the room neat ;  it's comfortable enough . <s> Obviously you get what you pay forâ€¦ the price is steep but it's well worth it . <s> I booked memorial day stay ;  which gives you 20 %  if you book 2 nights ;  add in senior discount  ( over 55 )  and AAA ;  and saved me a bit keeping it at only 234 / night . <s> Biggest plus was the courteous helpful service ;  as mentioned ;  as well as other luxury you get at any good hotel like this one . <s> The hotel is well located ;  but the service is poor . <s> They seem to cater to large conventioneers ;  with service more like a moderate chain hotel - not your typical Fairmont . <s> There are too many specifics to outline here ;  let's just say that from the front desk ;  to the spa ;  room service which only got my order correct one-day ;  to housekeeping which didn't even clean my room one day  ( although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room . <s> Yep ;  that's just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings ! <s> They did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience ! <s> The hotel is large and many times between 5-7 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator . <s> I've stayed at this Fairmont twice . <s> The 1st time I attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price . <s> But it's not worth enduring such poor service . <s> That was the last time for me . <s> My company was hosting a seminar at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago ;  IL . <s> Each participant of the seminar stayed in one of the luxurious rooms at the hotel . <s> My room had an incredible view of downtown Chicago and the styles of the rooms were very modern . <s> My husband was able to stay back in the room and enjoy the large flat screen television while I attended the seminar in one of the hotels meeting rooms . <s> On Saturday night ;  my company held a ball in the Crystal Ballroom . <s> The food was excellent ;  the hotel chefs were the best . <s> The servers were polite and were right there to fill up our drinks or bring us more food at the dinner . <s> Our overall stay at Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel will be forever in my memory . <s> It was a fun filled weekend with great food ;  clean rooms ;  excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want ! <s> We will definitely be staying here again ! <s> homewood suites chicago - I paid  $ 300 a night to stay at this dump ;  and I'll never do it again ! <s> The room was small ;  the bed was lumpy ;  and the maid woke me up at 7am to clean the room . <s> It wasn't all bad ;  though ;  since I was able to be the first to the breakfast buffet . <s> If they remodeled the interior and hired competent staff ;  it would be an okay hotel ;  but for now you can do better . <s> I was attending a training conference in Chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held . <s> I booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location  ( an easy walk to the conference )  . <s> From the lobby to the rooms ;  this hotel lives up to it's storied reputation . <s>  ( The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie ! <s>  )  And even tho' I was there for a conference ;  the hotel's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters ;  made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price . <s> Not a good start when the front desk isn't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room ! <s> We reserved a King Suite ;  and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front . <s> Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch ;  he offered us a free breakfast ;  but would not up-grade our room . <s> The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni . <s> We will not be retuning to this Hotel again . <s> Hilton Chicago - Stayed at Hilton in March and I must say ;  Hilton is not what it used to be !  ! <s> I had a lot of expectations from this place looking at the prices and reputation . <s> The first look is great ;  with all the classic ballrooms and lobbies . <s> Now comes the bad part ;  the rooms are BIG ;  just BIG ;  not comfortable . <s> Also I noticed a stain on the sheets when I entered the room . <s> We have to pay for the Wi-fi here !  ! <s> I mean seriously ?  ? <s> Almost all the hotels now-a-days provide free Wi-Fi in rooms . <s> I found it very inconvenient . <s> All in all ;   go stay somewhere else ;  itâ€™s not worth the fortune you will have to pay !  ! <s> Just got back from a 10 day visit to Chicago . <s> For the rate of  $ 219 per night ;  it was extremely good value . <s> Reception staff were efficient ;  courteous and very friendly . <s> I was given a room on the top floor  ( 32nd floor )  facing the lake and the John Hancock Tower . <s> The rooms were large and very comfortable . <s> Housekeeping / Turn Down Service were efficient and thorough . <s> Bathroom amenities were very good and replaced daily . <s> This is definitely my first choice for a Hotel in Chicago . <s> It is also very close to all the shops ;  restaurants and the subway . <s> As a frequent traveler for work ;  I stay at many SPG properties . <s> Compared to all the SPG property in Chicago ;  this is by far the worst . <s> Why ? <s> 1 )  They charge you to use the gym . <s>  $ 12 per day or something like  $ 24 for your entire stay . <s> I can't even begin on what a rip off that is . <s> 2 )  As a Gold or Platinum member ;  you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room . <s> They do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one . <s> 3 )  They do not have wireless internet . <s> It is 2010- enough said . <s> To charge you at least over  $ 200 a night ;  all the above amenities should be built into that cost . <s> I would never stay here again . <s> Under the gloss of a nice building ;  friendly staff ;  and a wild set of items in the minibar ;  this is somewhat below-average hotel . <s> In particular ;  the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable I ever encountered . <s> After two nights ;  my wife and I were practically cripped by bed pain . <s> We complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room ;  but the other room was furnished identically . <s> The owners of the Omni need to stop spending money on bath salts for the rooms and invest in the basic comforts . <s> I should not be lying on the floor ;  trying to unkink my back ;  thinking longingly of the last Red Roof Inn I visited . <s> My wife and I checked in to this hotel after a rough flight from Los Angeles . <s> We decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel while visiting our recently graduated son ;  and we were not disappointed . <s> The location could not have been better ;  as we were afforded easy access to Chicago's culture and shopping by being just off Michigan Avenue . <s> After a long day of exploring the city ;  we enjoyed a fantastic dinner on the terrace overlooking the city . <s> The halibut was cooked just right ;  and our waiter made us feel very welcome with some friendly conversation . <s> Overall ;  I would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in Chicago ! <s> Upon check in - the lobby was BUSY ! <s> I was tired and not feeling well from a tough road show . <s> The Front Desk person I checked in with was so fast and so nice that I walked away from the desk smiling ...  that alone was such a great feeling . <s> Every time I had any experience with a hotel staff member ;  I was so pleased ! <s> I have to say - service really is everything to me and I have to give this top marks for that . <s> An added bonus was the location ... <s> I just think it is perfect for me . <s> On top of that ;  I had a meeting down in the loop ;  but not quite sure how to get there - a person approached me in the lobby ;  asked if he could help me get to my meeting . <s> I thought he was getting me a taxi - but no - he walked me to his SUV and drove me to the meeting ;   " just a free service from the hotel "  he stated as we drove ... <s> really !  !  !  ! <s> so cool ! <s> I haven't even talked about the Pump Room yet - great dinner ;  very professional service ;  and no attitude . <s> I will return - just up date the rooms a little bit ;  thats all ...  the curtains need some help . <s> Nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways ;  fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the Omni . <s> Location was great but there are a lot of other options . <s> If you get a really good deal on the room ;  I wouldn't say no . <s> Fairmont Chicago - The hotel is centrally located but lacks charisma even after renovation . <s> The breakfast at the hotel is unreasonably expensive but there's a wonderful cafe just after a minute walk towards Millenium Park . <s> The sad part is that the hotel doesn't have a swimming pool and had to go to neighbouring health club for that . <s> The design of bathroom is good but a double vanity would have been expected and rooms are ok . <s> The disappointment is truely in service where they brought another brand of wine to the room instead of the ordered one . <s> It they informed first about this ;  atleast honesty of the staff would have been appreciated . <s> It seems that time arrived to look for the hotels with better experience and reasonable tariff . <s> While making the obligatory trip to the Chicago area to visit family ;  we decided to make it fun for the teenage members of our group and reserved a couple of rooms at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago . <s> What a great decision ! <s> The rooms are very upscale at a reasonable price with great amenities . <s> And ;  according the younger members of the family ;   " very cool "  ! <s> We can't wait to come back . <s> The James Hotel in Chicago looks nice on the website ;  but looks can be deceiving ! <s> The employees are extremely rude and the rooms are disgusting . <s> I would definitely advise against staying there . <s> HyattRegencyChicago-Overall We had booked five rooms for a conference in the area and I can honestly say we all felt a bit shafted after our stay . <s> The rooms themselves were comfortable enough ;  standard hotel fare . <s> However ;  the staff was cold and difficult to get ahold of at times . <s> Perhaps most importantly ;  the wifi service was not offered for free . <s> For a hotel that caters to those on business ;  this is completely unacceptable . <s> Hotel Allegro - I stayed at Hotel Allegro ;  which is conveniently located in the heart of Chicago . <s> Being here for a business meeting ;  I felt slightly indulgent and decided to book this hotel . <s> Despite my initial hesitation ;  I must say that I don't regret my decision at all ! <s> The staff was amazing and very attentive to my needs ;  the concierge asked about my busy schedule ;  and every night thereafter I would find some wine delivered to my room ! <s> Nothing felt more relaxing than having my own LCD TV ;  using the in-hotel overnight dry cleaning services ;  and being in the middle of the theatre district . <s> Having done a lot of acting in the past ;  I very much enjoyed the Cadillac Palace Theatre ;  located so close by ! <s> Overall ;  I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable / relaxing experience ! <s> I stayed at Sofitel with my husband for a weekend and I will NEVER be staying again ! <s> The staff was rude ;  the room was dirty ;  and the decor is ugly and garish . <s> AVOID at all costs ! <s> After Leaving some important documents in the room ;  I called and asked for the lost and found department ... <s> SEVEN TIMES over the course of a week . <s> Eventually I had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected . <s> Finally  ;  a deceivingly friendly operator PROMISED me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes ;  It never happened . <s> So Avoid this place because after they rip you off once they'll keep doing it later . <s> They cannot be trusted at their word <s> Very Very noisy - Constant water running through pipes . <s> It was terrible !  ! <s> There are much better hotels to stay at in Chicago . <s> Thier parking rate is obnoxious  (  $ 42 . 00 a night )  and way too far out to walk to much . <s> If you must stay here ;  try to park for free on dead end street  ( feed meter on weekdays )  and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a Jewel grocery store for sodas / snacks . <s>  ( A can of soda at the hotel was  $ 4 . 50 plus 18 %  restocking fee !  ! <s>  )  <s> Stayed in April for two nights . <s> I hesitated selecting the Sheraton becaue I had a very poor stay there earlier this year . <s> As far as I'm concerned ;  that's two strikes and I won't give them a chance at  #  three . <s> Doormen wouldn't help on arrival ;  huge line at c / i ;  lousy room ;  malfunctioning remote ;  unresponsive staff ;  and incorrect bill . <s> If you want to be close to Michigan Ave ;  try the Westin or Intercontinental and spare yourself the problems . <s> I don't understand why certain places never improve . <s> Is it that tough to properly train a staff ? <s> I stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of  $ 149 . <s> I was worried that I wouldn't get a nice room ;  since it was the weekend before the election and the hotel is across the street from Grant Park ;  so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms . <s> I requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic ;  and that is exactly what I was assigned  ( perhaps because I am also a 'silver' member ?  )  . <s> It was a beautiful room with windows on two sides ;  a king sized bed . <s> The room was quiet ;  comfortable and immaculate . <s> The maid even left a thank you note for the tip I had left . <s> All the staff were helpful ;  polite and cheerful . <s> I appreciated the fact that I could actually purchase a breakfast for under  $ 15  ( oatmeal ;  coffee ;  and juice )  -- something not possible at a lot of big hotels ;  like the Hyatt I stayed at last year . <s> I traveled to Chicago recently with my giant German Shepard dog Rex and picked the Hard Rock Hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness . <s> The service truly is incredible . <s> They even had a web-cam so I could check in on Rex while I was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when I could not make it home from a meeting the day after . <s> The rooms really rock  ( pardon the pun )  . <s> Nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets . <s> The easy chair looked so good that I was almost afraid Rex would snack on it while I was out ;  but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better . <s> I would definitely recommend the Hard Rock Hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets . <s> In my experience the Ambassador hotel didn't seem to be a 3 1 / 2 star establishment . <s> The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated . <s> The carpeting was very old and worn . <s> The floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable . <s> I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel . <s> Currently ;  it's indespirate need of renovation . <s> Just putting in a good word for the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago . <s> The reviews I read before going were mixed so we were not sure what to expect . <s> The location was perfect . <s> The hotel was beautiful . <s> Our view was awesome . <s> The room was large enough and very clean . <s> The bed was very comfy . <s> The staff were helpful - especially the concierge ;  Jared . <s> I couldn't find anything negative to say . <s> If you want to stay in downtown Chicago - you can't go wrong with this cool hotel . <s> We really enjoyed our brief stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker ! <s> From the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender ;  everyone we met was helpful and welcoming . <s> Our 11th-floor room was clean and beautiful ;  and the view looking north to the Drake Hotel and apartments across the street was nice . <s> The in-room coffee service was appreciated ;  too . <s> There isn't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries ;  but I'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious-but-cookie-cutter room any day ! <s> We got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels' website newsletter . <s> Affinia has a great location just off Michigan Avenue near the Water Tower . <s> Beware however :  parking is expensive in the Gold Coast ....  $ 48 / night . <s> Right from the start ;  Victor greeted us and made us feel welcome . <s> Check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous . <s> However ;  it was a handicapped acessible room and I wanted a tub ;  so one call to the front desk and we had another room . <s> All rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful ;  comfortable and well appointed . <s> The rooftop bar is a must-do . <s> The outside patio has heaters and candles ;  a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views . <s> We didn't sit inside the bar area . <s> Pedro and Quentin were excellent bellmen ;  and Christopher  ( concierge )  was very helpful . <s> As we left ;  we shook Victor's hand  ( he's always there ! <s>  )  and told him we've found our new Chicago hotel ! <s> I just came back from this awesome ;  terrific hotel last week ;  and I have to say --  I loved it ! <s> My wife and I were there for a week due to a business meeting ;  and right when I stepped into the hotel ;  I knew that this business vacation will be well spent . <s> The customer service was very great ;  and an employee even guided us toward our room ! <s> We were introduced to a fantastically lit room with 2 beds ;  a flat screen TV ;  and even free internet access . <s> My wife loved it ;  and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap . <s> When I headed down to the lobby for my conference ;  I got lost ;  and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held . <s> He leaded me to the door ;  and I was very impressed . <s> There is a fitness center which I went everyday ;  and this great restaurant called C-House situated nicely next to the hotel lobby ;  where I had a nice steak and my wife a salad . <s> All in all ;  I thought that the trip was really worth it ;  and my stay was very welcoming at the Affinia Chicago . <s> I highly recommend that whenever you visit Chicago you should stay there ;  you will not regret it . <s> I just returned from a long weekend in Chicago with my wife . <s> We stayed at the Affinia hotel and I can't even begin to describe what an awful experience it was . <s> When we arrived at 4pm on Thursday  ( check-in is 3pm )  ;  our room was not ready . <s> We had to wait til almost 5pm before we could even get into the room . <s> Once inside the room smelled like an ash tray . <s> Obviously someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room . <s> We decided to just go out for an early dinner . <s> After arriving back to our room around 9pm ;  our key didn't work . <s> We had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one . <s> The next morning the maids started knocking on our door at 7 : 30 in the morning ! <s> Why would you try to clean the room that early ?  ?  !  ! <s> The 'do not disturb' sign was on our door for the rest of the stay . <s> After that early wakeup ;  we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned . <s> The front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when I asked . <s> Eventually we did get a new room but I didn't enjoy the demeanor I encountered to do so . <s> Our new room was fairly nice ;  and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful ;  but I have a bad taste in my mouth and likely won't stay there again . <s> Omni Chicago Hotel – Stayed here for 2 nights on a business conference . <s> Wifi in my room was unreliable and basically unusable . <s> When I called the front desk about the problem ;  they seem confused and were less than helpful . <s> Without wifi ;  I had to rely on the slow 3G connection on my phone for responding to important business emails . <s> My room also suffered from quite a bit of street noise . <s> I recommend that all business travellers avoid this hotel . <s> I booked two rooms four months in advance at the Talbott . <s> We were placed on the top floor next to the elevators ;  which are used all night long . <s> When speaking to the front desk ;  I was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor ;  which I had requested for a better view . <s> I am looking at a brick wall ;  and getting no sleep . <s> He also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor ;  and were aware of the noise problem . <s> Why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked ? <s> A request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the TOP floor and using that request to justify this . <s> If you decide to stay here ;  request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator ! <s> I spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences . <s> This is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain . <s> At the last minute ;  my son and I decided to take a quick trip to Chicago to see the Cubs . <s> After checking Priceline I decided to book the Omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel . <s> We arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready ( I had called ahead and requested early arrival )  . The front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating . <s> The room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel . <s> The room was spotless and the bed was VERY comfortable . <s> There was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room !  ! <s>  ! We then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch . <s> Our service was great as was the food . <s> We also tried several restaurants around the Omni-all within walking distance . <s> The service ;  cleanliness and location of the Omni were incredible . <s> We will definitely go back . <s> My husband and I stayed at The Palmer House Hilton last month to celebrate our anniversary . <s> What a wonderful hotel !  ! <s> We had such a great weekend ;  largely thanks to The Palmer House . <s> Every amenity we could want was right there at the hotel ;  at our fingertips . <s> And the location is perfect -- right in downtown Chicago . <s> We stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites . <s> It was exquisite -- so elegant and beautiful . <s> It was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in . <s> The service was impeccable . <s> Every employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed . <s> We had our anniversary dinner at the Lockwood Restaurant in the hotel . <s> It was delicious ! <s> We will definitely return to the Palmer House Hilton for our next special weekend getaway . <s> We've stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service - the staff wasn't rude ;  just incompetent . <s> For example ;  we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room ;  which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel . <s> Nonetheless ;  the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs ... <s> The list of issues goes on unfortunately ;  including the low grade in-room movie options - our audio and video did not sync on our rental ;  we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes . <s> And the room itself was not clean ;  the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold . <s> Clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities ;  but training or sufficient staff ...  oh ;  but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same . <s> Find a newer hotel ;  there are many in this great city . <s> JAMES HOTEL ;  CHICAGO - REVIEW  Hotel is located in one of the best places in Chicago ;  magnificent mile . <s> Though the hotel is located in a good location ;  it is quite expensive . <s> The rooms are quite normal for the expense price which is  $ 197-217 for night in guest rooms . <s> The only restaurant and bar is David burkes prime house and others bars are still in construction . <s> The restaurant allows pets like dog which make it bit uncomfortable and disturbing to other rooms due to barking ;  movement of them in the hotel . <s> Overall the stay was quite ordinary . <s> Not worth the price ;  even a little bit . <s> A week prior to scheduled check-in ;  receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting ;  of course ;  upon arrival ;  nobody knows about it . <s> Typical . <s> After nobody was doing anything about it ;  I notified them of this stay's review will be posted on the newly-developing TheChicagoCritic  . <s> Com ;  all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early check-in . <s> Too little ;  Too late . <s> Very small room with 2 queens instead of the  " Select King "  I was supposed to have . <s> Windows didnt open ;  TV took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable . <s> The faboulous Lodge Net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests ;  well there was no check out feature . <s> This shit hole couldn't hold a candle to the Las Vegas Hard Rock ! <s> This a great property ;  excellent location and wonderful staff . <s> Everyone was very accommodating and polite . <s> The room I had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite ;  with a living area and a bedroom . <s> The living room was spacious ;  with a plasma TV ;  a desk and a couch . <s> The beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality . <s> In the closed they placed an umbrella ;  which came in handy ;  it rained the whole time I was in Chicago . <s> The internet connection is  $ 9 . 95 / 24hrs . <s> Great place ;  I will return for sure . <s> Maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest - couldn't get a room thru Fairmont website as busy weekend with Ryder Cup ..... but never have had this experience in using priceline before . <s> The night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful . <s> We were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room . <s> We had comforter with dirt in several places - and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space - had to use ironing board for toiletries . <s> This hotel is huge and not at capacity - may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby . <s> Hallways ;  rooms ;  carpet run down - just not what you come to expect of a fairmont . <s> I have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst . <s> Maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updated ... we paid as much as other guest and I'm a Fairmont Gold member . <s> Positives - great location ;  daytime staff helpful at desk - they have two bikes to borrow which is handy . <s> Views could be great if you get a higher room . <s> Checked out the Raddison Blu across street - looked much nicer !  !  ! <s> Stayed at the Chicago Hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door I was very impressed . <s> Check-in was quick ;  easy and I was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time . <s> We were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant . <s> It made getting ready to go out much quicker ! <s> The hotel location is great opposite the park ;  which is a must see . <s> Although located on South Michigan Ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of Michigan Ave .  Would also recommend the street one block back from Michigan Ave for good shopping . <s> For breakfast I would recommend grabbing a muffin ;  croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant . <s> For evening entertainment Kitty O'Sheas is a must . <s> Typical Irish bar with good drinks and live music . <s> Finally the bed at Hilton Chicago is the most comfortable bed ever . <s> I would have taken it home if I could ! <s> Definately made for a good nights sleep . <s> InterContinental Chicago - This hotel is the worst of the 5 star hotels in Chicago I have ever been . <s> Last week ;  my husband and I had to live there because other hotels are full those days . <s> The receptionist there was very rude and the doorman even asked us to get the luggage situated by ourself . <s> The room was pretty small that it has only enough space for a bed and the carpet was dirty . <s> Moreover ;  one night when I was sleeping ;  there was a fight next door . <s> I couldn't fall to sleep due to the poor sound insulation . <s> In addition ;  the faucet has been leaking all the day ;  especially noisy at night and the air conditioning doesn't work well ;  my husband and I felt so hot in the night . <s> The room and the service isn't worth the money . <s> I would never stay there again . <s> My family stayed at the Hotel Monaco Hotel in Chicago from 2-5 September 2011 . <s> I have no complaints about the rooms but I do have to complain about the staff in general . <s> When we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children ;  take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way . <s> The cleaning crew the next morning didn't even knock at our door before opening the door . <s> My children were still sleeping and I was in the shower . <s> Thank god my husband was already at his conference . <s> The hotel was beautiful but the staff makes for a horrible experience . <s> Louisiana resident . <s> From the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me . <s> Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly . <s> I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room ;  which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight ;  and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago . <s> After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant . <s> Overall my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit . <s> This hotel is one superior hotel . <s> The prices are reasonable and the benefits are just fantastic . <s> My husband and I got a package that lets us get a hotel with a view and the view was amazing . <s> Waking up to seeing Lake Michigan was a site not to miss . <s> The rooms were always cleaned when we got back from our shopping at Bloomingdales or in other places in Chicago ;  and the customer service was top notch and very friendly . <s> Even though the reviews of this hotel are very good ;  the only good thing about it is the Location ;  which is excelent . <s> aside from that ;  there are only 2 elevators ;  so there is ALWAYS a wait to get in . <s> they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage ;  room service ;  etc takes forever . <s> even if you arrive in a cab ;  there is no space to load / unload so you have to block the street while you arrive / depart ;  the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh . <s> all in all ;  there are much better options in Chicago <s> I'll keep it short . <s> My wife ;  daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights . <s> We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel . <s> Location :  It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile  ( Michigan Ave .  )  ;  so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do . <s> Hotel :  The hotel itself is very clean ;  as were the rooms . <s> Maid service was excellent ;  including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service  ( I think they missed a night )  . <s> Service :  Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind . <s> They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile . <s> Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room  ( sometimes chocolates on our pillows )  . <s> They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it . <s> There was no shortage of people to ask things . <s> My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get . <s> They shouuld have more than one ;  or longer hours . <s> Other :  We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good ;  and well attended ;  appointed . <s> They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet . <s> The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids . <s> It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking . <s> Pool and changing areas were spotless . <s> Room :  Clean ;  sunny and spacious . <s> Probably over 400 sq . <s> ft .  - 2 TVs ;  couch ;  desk ;  chairs - all in perfect shape . <s> The windows open for some fresh air . <s> Pillows were pretty comfortable . <s> With all aspects considered ;  I think this was an unbeatable value ! <s> I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend . <s> I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel . <s> It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there . <s> Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number . <s> The airlines have cornered the market on that . <s> I have heard friends talking about the Hotel Monaco in Chicago and did have my doubts at first . <s> However when I arrived there was amazed at the location ! <s> It is near so many shopping places ;  museums ;  theatre ;  and many others places . <s> Was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long ;  however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay . <s> Fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day ! <s> The staff at the place is amazing I even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people . <s> One day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best I have ever had at a hotel . <s> All and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room ;  good service ;  and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby ;  will be heading back to this hotel many times . <s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I'm kind of torn on this one . <s> I really want to give this hotel a good rating . <s> The food and room service were great ;  and the room definitely looked fantastic . <s> But I can't get over the fact that the beds just feel like one of those old spring mattresses ;  you know ? <s> Add that to the fact that the hotel's proximity to the Magnificent Mile means that there's lot of noise at night ;  and I was tossing and turning for most of my nights here . <s> And considering how important a good night's rest is ;  this makes it really difficult for me to recommend this hotel . <s> Maybe someone who sleeps more soundly than me would find this place better . <s> Well ;  this used to be a Le Meridian Hotel ;  and it has changed for the worse . <s> We kept having to remind them we booked a package ;  because we were being over-charged separately for everything ;  when it should have been included . <s> We were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival ;  and did not . <s> Two phone calls and three hours later ;  it finally showed up . <s> We tried to have a drink in the bar ;  and even though we were the ONLY people there ;  three servers / bartenders came and went ;  talking to each other ;  not one of them acknowledging us . <s> After ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink . <s> And don't bother to pay extra for  " City View "  ;  because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor ;  looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see . <s> Oh yes ;  the valet lost his cell phone in someone's car ;  and called me at home today to see if we found it . <s> He wanted me to call him back at home . <s> Nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff ;  huh ? <s> For the money ;  stay at any other hotel in Chicago with the same price-point and it will be much much better . <s> My wife and I decided to spend three days in Chicago last summer ;  and booked via Expedia . <s> When we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its' beauty . <s> It's like something out of Europe . <s> We were able to get a free room upgrade ;  even though the rooms are still a bit small ;  but its' an old hotel in an old city . <s> It's there for sleeping and showering . <s> The restaurants ;  lounges ;  and shops were all wonderfull . <s> The next time we travel to Chicago ;  I'll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the Palmer House Hilton <s> We travel to Chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the Hilton Chicago . <s> We booked a PriceLine room on the weekend of the half marathon . <s> The place was busy ;  but the staff certainly found time for each individual guest . <s> The room was nice and just what we expected . <s> The pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel . <s> The location was great as we were taking in the Bears 49ers game on a Thursday night and a Sox game on a Friiday night . <s> We would certainly stay there again and would recomment it to others . <s> Great quality even at the regular room price . <s> Check ins went smoothly . <s> But be advised .... <s> Walls are super thin ;  the building is old and the rooms are very very very small . <s> The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out . <s> For the price it wasn't bad . <s> It was walking distance to most major attractions . <s> Overall  ...  it's ok at best . <s> Another plus is the CTA is close by . <s> I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago ;  an older hotel with a great reno  ( a bit over-the-top design ;  but still very lovely and charming )  ;  clean rooms ;  and very friendly staff . <s> They're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag  ( treats and directions to an off-leash area )  ;  and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog's names on it . <s> Hi ; Stayed here for three nights recently ; From check in to check out all Staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and if there was anything they could do to help us ; directions ; restaurants ;  transport ; nothing was too much trouble ; The dinner from monday to thursday 5-7 was a wonderful surprise ; also the breakfast was more than adequet ; Stayed on the 15th floor and slept soundly ; Hotel close to everything for the tourist or business traveller . Restaurants and shopping all within 5-10 mins . <s> We will not be back to this hotel . <s> There are several reasons for this ;  but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight . <s> Our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it . <s> The room was OK ;  but the beds were hard and uncomfortable . <s> The room next door had their TV turned up very loudly ;  and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option . <s> They didn't offer any other solutions . <s> The food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests . <s> Overall ;  we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in Chicago . <s> The Omni Hotels ;  Chicago - My experience with the Omni has not been satisfactory . <s> The room service was late most of the times and the fact that the food was not amazing did not make the wait worth it . <s> The rooms were big and clean but the cleaning were not properly trained . <s> Once ;  a cleanig lady barged into my room without knocking which was irritating . <s> The internet speed was also largely shaky bordering around low speed most of the times . <s> The only good part ;  for me ;  probably was the gym which was really equipped and beautiful . <s> On the whole ;  I would not recommend this hotel for a short stay . <s> Having made regular business trips to Chicago ;  I decided to stay at the Hotel Monaco Chicago ;  since it was fairly new and I had a friend that had stayed there . <s> The Lobby was quite small ;  which surprised me with a name like Monaco . <s> As a matter of fact I found the furnishings to be quite drab . A boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite . <s> It was two rooms ;  not as spacious as I would have liked ;  an entertainment room ;  and a bedroom with a standard television . <s> Can You imagine ;  I was expecting H . D . <s>  ;  but it was just ordinary cable . <s> For  $ 600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set . <s> The bath was ordinary ;  nothing special ;  but the bed was a very big King . The view did not take in the Lake ;  unfortunately ;  just the Magic Mile . <s> Well ;  I am starving so time to eat . <s> The restaurant was well appointed ;  I hope the food was as good . <s> I ordered lamb chops ;  potatoes au gratin and mint sauce . <s> It was fair . <s> I hope the rest of my trip si better than my accomadations . <s> I would give this hotel a two and a half ;  but I would not return . <s> we love the location and proximity to everything . <s> The staff was very friendly and courteous . <s> They were so nice to our 2 . 5 year old boy . <s> got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived . <s> We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program  . <s> Can't beat that ! <s> the only minor issue is the elevator . <s> we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room . <s> It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often . <s> Otherwise ;  it was a great stay ! <s> Hard Rock Hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays . <s> What they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be . <s> The service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons ;  service is more redily available and friendly the more you make . The rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings . <s> The laundry service leaves more to be desired . <s> The sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco . <s> I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the bedding . Your stay at any hotel should be memorable and restful-after all isnt that what we pay for ? <s> The Ambassador East is a particularly crappy property ;  given the numerous quality hotels in and around the Gold Coast . <s> Unfortunately ;  I saw an amazing rate and decided to book  --  this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for . <s> While the lobby was gorgeous  ( and appears to match the photos on the website )  the room I was assigned was run down ;  and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website . <s> It looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls ;  but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty . <s> The room also smelled of must or mildew . <s> While the room did have air-conditioning as advertised ;  it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg . <s> I was only here for a single night ;  but had I been here for anywhere longer I would have requested a refund . <s> Please ;  if you're staying in this part of town ;  do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here . <s> The Hampton Inn and Hilton Garden Inn are both nearby ;  clean ;  and often have special-offers  --  these aren't the only properties in the area ;  but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay . <s> staff was very courteous . <s> desk clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two . <s> second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day ;  causing us to miss the free period . <s> room was very clean ;  with a nice view of the river . <s> bed was very comfortable . <s> toilet looked like it belonged in a public restroom  ( no tank ;  instead it had a stainless steel valve )  instead of a 4-star hotel . <s> no dresser to store clothes . <s> no wastebasket in the room ;  and there was a cover for the icebucket ;  but no icebucket . <s> folding luggage stand had a broken strap . <s> location was good ;  close to the river . <s> several american-style eating places nearby . <s> overall ;  a disappointment for a four-star hotel . <s> i expected more for a hyatt regency . <s> This hotel had a great location ;  but you can do much better for the money . <s> The hallways smelled of smoke ;  dirty elevators ;  furniture in the lobby was thread bare . <s> The staff was very helpful . <s> The room was large ;  bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered . <s> If you have any allergies don't stay here ! <s> Fairmont - I wasn't expecting much from a guest room at a place like the Fairmont ;  but I was surprised to see that even the modest amenities here are quite comfortable . <s> Like any room on the cheaper side of a hotel ;  there are cheesy things like floral paintings and a bible in the drawer ;  but this one somehow does it with a bit of class . <s> The tub being separate from the shower was kind of a nice touch and it has a great view of the Chicago skyline <s> For 250 dollars ;  cheapest room available at the Hard Rock Hotel Chicago ;  you would assume you would have access to wifi . <s> Yet ;  that was not the case . <s> I was told I  " could have had "  internet if I had booked through the site ;  which I didnt . <s> The lady in the reception had no idea what she was talking about and had to ask around about internet access in general . <s> A hotel made for royalty . <s> Decked out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of ;  it is an amazing experience ! <s> It's located right in the middle of everything in Chicago ;  and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience . <s> The customer service was fantastic ;  as they were very responsive and polite to my requests and fixed any complaints without a complaint of their own . <s> A beautiful experience that I would certainly do again ! <s> My wife and I recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids . <s> Upon check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor ;  the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff . <s> As a seasoned traveler for business I consider myself somewhat savvy when it comes to service and accommodations . <s> This hotel certainly delivers on both accounts . <s> My wife and I had not intended on eating in the hotel restaurant ;  but after reviewing the menu we thought we would give it a try . <s> WOW ! <s> Service was outstanding and the food was amazing . <s> We truly enjoyed our dining experience . <s> All in all I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone I meet . <s> Great building and location ;  but ...  staff is indifferent ;  you have to pay for WiFi  ( after  $ 300 usd / night I would expect at least free WiFi )  ;  no pool in the building and something I found really annoying is that ;  if you move anything from the minibar ;  they have sensors that automatically charge you . <s> This is ridicoulus . The iPod dock in the room didn't work . <s> Also ;  we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over . <s> Definitely is not value for your money . <s> You're just paying for the Hard Rock brand . <s> I will never go back to a Hard Rock Hotel . <s> our stay was absolutely perfect . <s> its a cool hotel to look at ;  the design and feel is very trendy and hip . <s> all the staff are terrific ;  especially the consierge staff-great info and attitude . <s> our room was on the top floor ;  with great views . <s> super comfy bed ;  and neat bathroom . <s> fantastic ;  choose this with no hesitation ! <s> Three nights there on business . <s> Hadn't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement ;  very bleak . <s> Told the front desk that I hadn't realized about the construction ;  so I'd have to switch hotels ;  they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights . <s> So I stayed . <s> TV didn't work . <s> Tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me ... eventually after I called again ;  a few hours later ;  a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it . <s> Long and complicated experience at the business center  ( which doesn't open until 9am ;  BTW )  ;  where I ended up paying  $ 45 to print 55 pages . <s> Had to buy these cards ;  and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway ;   ( and charging me for them )  . <s> I was left with  $ 22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the Swissotel in Chicago ;  2000 miles from where I live . <s> I asked for a refund on the card and  --  no surprise  --  she declined to help me with that . <s> Nice room ;  nice view ;  but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad . <s> Worst experience I've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business . <s> Allegro Chicago - It was the best hotel I have stayed at in Chicago . <s> Me and my fiance stayed there for two nights and the stay was absolutely amazing . <s> The location is great as the hotel is right in the center of the city . <s> The rooms are luxurious ;  with comfortable beds and exquisite bathrooms . <s> The ENTIRE staff at the hotel was service oriented . <s> Room service was great and the receptionist was very helful in getting the room ;  helping in booking the cab etc . <s> The Liquid Lounge is top notch . <s> We both had a wonderful time there and would love to visit again . <s> great bed ;  but when I first came in ;  I requested a room with a lake view  ( i requested this over the phone as well )  ;  and the front desk woman said  " this is a great room "  . <s> I go upstairs and its awful looking . <s> The view was of the neighboring roofs . <s> Then I spent half an hour trying to find a better room . <s> Eventually I got a corner roof with a partial view . <s> Horrible experience . <s> also rooms were small and had crappy look  ( yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets )  <s> We choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel . <s> Not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor ;  but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay . <s> We did - as recommended - have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there . <s> There is no breakfast buffet - you order a la carte . <s> Keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet . <s> Also note that the minibar is empty on arrival - we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order . <s> We have stayed at the Omni before and it as a much better experience . <s> I dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel . <s> I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite . <s> No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals . <s> The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table  (  ! <s>  )  and canted forward . <s> Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer . <s> Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos ;  I have to assume this design flaw with the couch / futon runs throughout the property . <s> Bed was fine and bath was fine but I can't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well . <s> The couch / futon seating is the worst I've encountered in a modern hotel . <s> I stayed here for business and loved it . <s> Got it for  $ 93 inc tax on Priceline ;  an incredible deal for this hotel . <s> If I wasn't on priceline I would expect to pay  $ 200 per night  ( maybe more )  for this location / level of service . <s> It's in the heart of downtown Chicago ;  walkable to many locations . <s> The lobby is very impressive ;  the room was very nice . <s> No complaints at all ;  from check-in to check-out . <s> I was alone so didn't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves . <s> It was full of people all the time . <s> I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city . <s> We recently stayed at the Intercontinental Hotel for a week . <s> The hotel was in a wonderful location and the service was great . <s> We found all of the staff very helpful and prompt . <s> We highly recommend the Intercontinental for any travel needs whether it be for business or pleasure . <s> The heating in our room didn't work and wasn't repaired depite numerous requests ;  the rooms were very small ;  the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay ;  the cleaner made the bed but nothing else ;  when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having pre-paid through a travel agent ;  it took the hotel 2 months to re-credit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous trans-Atlantic phone calls to them . <s> We stayed at the Fairmont two nights for the SOFA art fair at the Navy Pier . <s> I was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly ;  which is quite unusual . <s> Everyone smiled and welcomed us . <s> The lobby looks clean and friendly ;  not ultramodern ;  but not at all tired or worn . <s> Our room ;  also clean and comfortably furnished ;  was larger than we expected ;  with a clean ;  modern bath and a lovely view of the Navy Pier and the lake . <s> We did not eat at the restaurant ;  but it looked attractive . <s> Our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows ;  upon reserving the room ;  upon checking in ;  and calling housekeeping . <s> After waiting an hour ;  we went to bed . <s> The next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned ;  all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials . <s> The hotel is convenient to Millenium Park and Michigan Ave .  We would stay there again ;  assuming we could get good rates . <s> Hilton Chicago - I wanted to like this hotel ...  it has several things going for it :  an elegant modern style ;  luxurious furnishings and amenities ;  and large rooms with spectacular views - in fact ;  almost all the rooms  ( except the ones on the western face of the hotel )  overlook scenic sections of Grant Park and Lake Michigan . <s> But while it was nice to look at ;  it was not exactly a pleasure to actually live there . <s> First ;  they are either under-staffed or over-booked - the hotel was so crowded when I stayed there last June that noise and service became issues . <s> The lobbies were so full that I couldn't ever find a place to sit down ;  and they were a chore to wade through as I travelled to and from my room . <s> The staff was reasonably pleasant ;  but they just couldn't adequately serve all of their guests . <s> Check-in / check-out took at least an hour ;  and I think they managed to get around to cleaning my bed linens only once during my five-day stay . <s> I would have liked to take advantage of the exercise spaces they advertised ;  but they happened to be closed for renovation . <s> The two main restaurants inside the hotel ;  a grill and an Irish pub ;  often had waiting times upwards of 45 min during peak hours . <s> To top it all off ;  they were generally too noisy for me to carry on a conversation with the other people at the table . <s> The noise was an even bigger problem at night ;  however - between standard city sounds like cars and sirens in the streets and the neighbors talking through the paper-thin walls ;  I hardly slept . <s> Luckily there were a few good restaurants near the hotel that I was able to escape to for a bit of peace . <s> There's at least three different pizza places about a block away ;  but if you want something a little more upscale and still Italian  ( my favorite )  ;  I suggest you try Gioco as it's only a bit more of a walk . <s> Overall ;  my experience here wasn't horrible ;  but I can't quite justify the price of admission ;  given the spotty service and my issues with the noise . <s> My room cost a steep  $ 250 dollars per night ;  which I now wish I had spent site-seeing around Chicago while staying somewhere cheaper instead . <s> If you've got a car ;  it's even worse :  parking costs  $ 45 . <s> I stayed at the Chicago Hilton because it was host to a conference I was attending . <s> Before I arrived I tried to find out about the  " In Room Fitness "  program advertised on the corporate website . <s> I called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center . <s> I explained that I was inquiring about the 'In Room Fitness' advertised on their website . <s> She put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that I should call the property directly . <s> I did and got the same response . <s> I asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room . <s> Again ;  this was a problem . <s> When I arrived at the hotel ;  no treadmill was available . <s> When I went to tour the fitness room the first night I found that they close at 9pm . <s> When I returned to the center the next day I discovered that they charge  $ 13 per day to use the fitness equipment . <s> The pool ;  track and locker room are free ;  but to use the treadmills ;  etc . <s> you have to pay  $ 13 per day . <s> This charge is not noted anywhere  --  not on the website ;  not in any of the guest service materials in the room . <s> The food for the conference was mediocre ;  but the one room service meal I had was pretty good . <s> During one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldn't hear the speaker . <s> The HVAC didn't work well in my room and I kept the windows open for most of my three night stay . <s> The beds were comfortable with very nice linens . <s> I tried to get a late checkout ;  which was offered on a card in my room . <s> The woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour ;  not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room . <s> The best service I received was from the folks in the Security office . <s> The hotel does not have safes in guest rooms ;  so I became very friendly with Security office as I locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time I couldn't carry it out of the hotel . <s> I visit Chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the Marriott properties . <s> Only wish I had done so for this visit . <s> I thought the Swissotel was a great hotel . <s> The rooms were very spacious and clean ;  especially for downtown Chicago standards . <s> Most importantly ;  the rooms were quiet . <s> I never heard people in the hallways when I was trying to sleep . <s> The only downside was that the beds were not anything special . <s> Sure ;  like all hotels in Chicago ;  this hotel caters to wealthy and / or business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price . <s> However ;  if you are aware of that prior to arrival ;  its not a big deal  ( ie finding a different place to park the car ;  bringing our own snacks for the room )  . <s> It would be nice though if hotels such as the Swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use . <s> Staff was very helpful . <s> Bellmen instantly got cabs upon request ;  and the front desk was efficient and helpful . <s> Overall ;  if I can get a good rate again ;  I'll stay at the Swissotel the next time I am in Chicago . <s> For a short time during vacation I had rented a room from The Ambassador East Hotel ;  I have to say I was quite impressed with what I experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location . <s> The hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed ;  and trust me I am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot . <s> The food is good ;  location is great ;  everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here . <s> The Palmer House - ( Warning )  The Palmer House made a bad on me right away . <s> I was unable to get a shuttle from the airport to the hotel ;  and when I called asking about the next one they said that it was not running for the day . <s> After my expensive cab ride to the hotel ;  I was dissapointed to see that the room looked nothing like the website described . <s> It was small and crowded with unecessary furniture . <s> I did not sleep well on the bed ;  although I am a picky sleeper . <s> I must admit that the atmosphere of the lobby and the common areas of the hotel were very nice ;  and I really enjoyed using their gym facilities in the basement ;  but that was not enough to make up for my lackluster experience with the customer service and my room . <s> The next time I travel to Chicago I will be trying a different hotel because the Palmer House did not live up to the expectations set by their price and the Hilton name . <s> I travel a lot for business and quite frankly ;  my expectations were starting to reach new lows . <s> I usually always choose W Hotels just for the consistency  ( of average hotels )  . <s> The Affinia in Chicago has raised my expectations and W Hotels are going to suffer in comparison . <s> This hotel is one of the cleanest I have stayed at in some time . <s> Service was impeccable . <s> Friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels I ordered arrived literally within minutes . <s> The gym has new equipment with plenty of space . <s> And such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music . <s> I have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the Affinia and I was so pleased . <s> My new  " Chicago Hotel "  . <s> It will even lead me to try the Manhattan hotels . <s> When you enter the lobby at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered . <s> The staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can . <s> The check in process is smooth and friendly as I expected . <s> When you enter your room the decor catches your eye . <s> Luxurious yet not stuffy is how I describe it . <s> The restroom tub is large and made of marble . <s> The whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home . <s> I highly recommend The Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while . <s> Complete disappointment . <s> Problems :  1 . <s> The alarm clock / stereo thing was broken in my room . <s> It was constantly emitting low ;  changing hissing noises . <s> Sooo annoying . <s> And there was no off switch on the damn thing . <s> I had to move the bed to unplug it  ( the outlet was wayyy back ;  buried behind the big bed )  . <s> I kept hearing it ;  and didn't realize what it was ;  until it had kept me awake for a few hours . <s> 2 . <s> The shower was ONLY incredibly hot . <s> Turn it all the way cold ... very hot . <s> Turn it to hot ;  and you get boiling hot . <s> Grrrrreat . <s> So how do I get water that won't scald me ? <s> This is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry ;  and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water . <s> Good job Omni ! <s> 3 . <s> Hallway carpets are disgusting and old . <s> Walking around ;  you'd think you're in a motel 6 . <s> And my floor had been flooded or something ;  and they had box fans running in the hallway ;  24 / 7 ;  to try to dry it out . <s> Talk about an overpriced dump . <s> From the moment I stepped up to the front entrance my luxury service began ! <s> I enjoyed every minute @ the fairmont ! <s> The King room was spacious and the decor chic ! <s> The coffee maker was the coolest and the bathroom is huge ! <s> I really like the separate shower ;  tub ;  and separate door for the toilet . <s> The desserts and cheese spread at ENO so yummy . <s> Before the fairmont the W hotel was my favorite chain of hotels to stay at . <s> Friendly staff ;  clean building and rooms . <s> The hotel was located nearby everything we were interested in seeing . <s> Staff was willing to help give directions and very knowledgable of city . <s> Rooms were beautifully designed and well lit ;  spacious and comfortable . <s> {\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf1038\cocoasubrtf360 {\fonttbl\f0\fswiss\fcharset0 Helvetica ; } {\colortbl ; \red255\green255\blue255 ; } \margl1440\margr1440\vieww9000\viewh8400\viewkind0 \pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\ql\qnatural\pardirnatural  \f0\fs24 \cf0 Homewood Suites- I've stayed here a couple of times and it makes my trips to Chicago as simple as possible . <s> I always prepay online so I literally get my room key in a minute ;  never any hassle . <s> Food is good ;  buffet style breakfast and decent dinner . <s> Even better ;  there a bunch of excellent restaurants within a few blocks . <s> My only complaint would be that your stay can definitely be effected by what side of the hotel your room is on . <s> Facing east ;  there is a great view of the harbor ;  but the westside overlooks a busy street that can be noisy long into the night . <s> The staff is very willing to accommodate any such concerns if you explicitly ask ;  but otherwise it can be a bit of a crapshoot . <s> So it is definitely something to remember when booking . <s> But with that said ;  I would recommend HS to anyone coming through the city . <s> Everything is quick ;  easy ;  and comfortable . <s> } <s> My wife and I were guests at the Hotel Allego in Chicago for a long weekend getaway  ( September 2 - 5 ;  2011 )  . <s> We had checked out the hotel's website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip . <s> Once we arrived ;  the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy . <s> When I asked to be moved to another room  ( my wife has asthma )  we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time . <s> The room was not particularly well-cleaned :  we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor ;  and a film of dust across the television set . <s> We are not the type to complain ;  so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it . <s> At nighttime when we tried to sleep ;  we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin ;  every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly . <s> We were tossing and turning half the night . <s> In the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day ;  but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated :  a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack . <s> The concierge was almost never around in the lobby  ( her sign always said  " Be right back ! <s>  "  )  and when we did ask her questions ;  she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us . <s> The second night was without incident ;  luckily ;  except for the terrible bed ;  but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our  " Do Not Disturb "  sign . <s> I would not recommend this hotel . <s> My husband and I went to Chicago for three nights for a quick get-away . <s> We chose Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park because it was located at the heart of the city ;  downtown Chicago . <s> The hotel itself was very elegant and modern . <s> The bed was extremely comfortable and I was able to wake up with music from my iPod . <s> I would definitely stay with them again . <s> What a disappointment this hotel was . <s> First ;  the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in . <s> When we finally got up to our room ;  we opened the door and found someone else was already in it ! <s> Yes ;  the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else's room . <s> We went back to the clerk who checked us in  ( skipping the still present line ;  which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting )  and told him the problem . <s> However ;  he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us . <s> He did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do . <s> This took a *very* long time . <s> It was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back . <s> He said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view . <s> The hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these ;  but when we got to this new room ;  we found out why these rooms hadn't been taken . <s> The room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel . <s> We briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel ;  but it was late already so we just decided to make do . <s> That was ;  of course ;  until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down . <s> Then somewhere around 7 : 30am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beep-beep backup sound and all sorts of other noise . <s> So much for a good night's sleep . <s> I suppose I should say the room itself looked nice ;  but with all the noise from the loading dock ;  who cares . <s> We gave up and checked out that morning to find another hotel . <s> Definitely not going back here ever again . <s> If you're in Chicago and want to stay in The Loop ;  The Allegro Hotel is perfect for you . <s> It's centrally located ;  stylish rooms and attentive staff . <s> I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was very pleased with everything . <s> The bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows ;  large flat screen tv ;  radio with ipod docking station and bathroom was hip and clean . <s> Everyone that I came in contact with was very friendly and helpful . <s> My last day there ;  I ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time ;  the kitchen called to see if everything was alright . <s> I have never had that kind of follow up service . <s> I've stayed at the Palomar in DC ;  another Kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too . <s> I will definitely see if Kimpton has a hotel at my next destination . <s> I was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel . <s> The overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance . <s> Given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level ;  this was most disappointing . <s> Nor was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff . <s> The windy city fairmont hotel is one of chicago's best recently renovated to bring it up to modern day luxury . <s> With fine dining atmosphere and hotel deluxe suites and the view that is breath taking . <s> This hotel can accommodate the guest no matter what you desire . <s> with a fabulous restaurant on the 15Th floor with dinning at its best . <s> With it over looking the great Chicago area . <s> So the next time your in the windy city come and stay with us where you will be pamper by our fine staff . <s> The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was by far one of the best experiences I've had . <s> It definitely felt as comfortable as home with the all the luxuriance of a five star establishment . <s> I had forgotten my favorite CD that puts me to sleep each night . <s> When mentioning this in front of the Front desk clerk ;  she told me that they have a huge collection of CD's available for guests . <s> Low and behold ;  they had my favorite CD !  ! <s> Also ;  my laptop was not cooperating . <s> Come to find out ;  they offer every guest full access to their amazing and fully functional business center ! <s> From now on ;  when visiting Chicago ;  I will ONLY be staying at the Amalfi Hotel ! <s> I checked into this hotel ;  Rm 1760 on 11 / 13 / 2010 . <s> Next day ;  I woke up with bed bug bites ;  numerous ;  on my arm and back . <s> We reported this to the management who assiged us to rm 1901 and promised to get the room inspected and  " taken care of "  . <s> I insisted that they get all my clothes laundered ;  which they did . <s> Interestingly ;  no one from the management ;  other than the security guy who came when we first complained ;  even offered any apology for the inconvience . <s> I missed couple of meetings that day . <s> The next day ;  I called as I forgot something in the previous room ;  only to discover that the room was already assigned to the next guest . <s> So much for reporting ! <s> Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis  ( not including our business travel )  . <s> We've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail . <s> We were not at all impressed by this hotel . <s> At  $ 220 / night we were expecting a decent ;  clean hotel but obviously not a 5* . <s> We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given  ( 1546 )  . <s> The paint / wallpaper / tub were peeling ;  there was hair in both the tub / toilet when we got to the room ;  the internet service was extremely slow ;  the toilet ran throughout the night ;  and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in . <s> We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was  " I know ;  we can't wait for our renovations . <s>  "  If it hadn't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK  &  booked into this hotel by a travel agent ;  we would have checked out as soon as we checked in . <s> Let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in / check-out process was painfully slow . <s> All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly / responsive door staff . <s> In its day this was likely a lovely hotel  &  but it is in dire need of a renovation . <s> Despite its location I cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience . <s> We would never book at this hotel again . <s> I wrote an email to the sales  &  reservation team a week ago ......... i'm still waiting for a response . <s> All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer . <s> We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails . <s> Shame you missed out ;  coz we tip like rockerfellers !  ! <s> We just returned from a relaxing stay at the InterContinental in Chicago . <s> I have to say the service was phenomenal ! <s> From the maid to the concierge and everyone in between ;  the staff treated us like royalty . <s> It was quite the treat to feel so special . <s> Our room was gorgeous . <s> The view of the city was breathtaking . <s> The luxury mattress and bedding made for the most comfortable peaceful slumber . <s> We found the marble bathroom stunning and impeccably clean . <s> My wife was very pleased with the lighted make-up mirror while I enjoyed the reliable Wi-Fi connection . <s> During our stay we dinned in the Zest . <s> Wow ! <s> They offer an extensive wine menu and a full array of gourmet food options . <s> We had to try the famous wiener schnitzel  --  it was scrumptious . <s> Afterwards ;  my wife and I shared the chocolate lava cake ;  can I just say oh that cake is to die for ! <s> Really the best we ever had . <s> In the morning we spent some time working off dinner at the junior olympic swimming pool ;  followed by an exhilarating round of cardio in the hotels dedicated cardio room . <s> Afterwards ;  a trip to the sauna was a well deserved refuge . <s> Overall ;  our stay at the InterContinental in Chicago was nothing short of fabulous . <s> This luxury hotel is complete with the finest of amenities and the most caring staff . <s> We are looking forward to staying at the InterContinental again ;  hopeful soon ! <s> I am writing in regards to our stay April 22-24 . <s> We were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay . <s> There was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay . <s> My husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival ... it wasn't . <s> When he called to place the order again ;  it never showed up . <s> We were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time . <s> Our room was very small ;  drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for . <s> We had called to request a room with a large tub ;  similar to the ones in the photos ;  prior to our arrival ;  noting that we didn't mind an upgrade cost . <s> Instead ;  the tub was incredibly small . <s> We have stayed at the Intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the Chicago location ;  especially considering we were celebrating such a happy ;  once-in-a-lifetime occasion . <s> The service and amenities just didn't match up . <s> I stayed here for 2 nights in May 2008 . <s> I have to say the hotel was exceptionally clean and very modern and funky . <s> They had a free wine tasting each evening ! <s> The restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay . <s> The hotel is located within walking distance to the metro system and also close to shopping  /  restaurants and sights ! <s> Rooms were lovely ;  althou the bathroom was slightly on the compact side . <s> Will be back . <s> My expectations were not high because I booked this hotel through priceline for  $ 58  /  night . <s> An amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for hot water . <s> I called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied :   " try running it for 15 to 20 minutes . <s>  "  They forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower ;  if anyone else expected to use the shower . <s> My boyfriend ;  who showered after me ;  had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again . <s> To make matters worse ;  after room service was delivered ;  we called and said we needed another fork . <s> They told us it would cost  $ 3  (  $ 1 for the fork ;   $ 2 for delivey charge )  . <s> Absolutely ridiculous !  ! <s> At least with a 1 star hotel ;  you get hot water . <s> This is supposed to be a 4 star hotel . <s> I guess you do get what you paid for - I just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price . <s> Wow ! <s> Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago ! <s> It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier ;  Lake Michigan ;  and all the fabulous dining . <s> The hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional ;  but cozy manner . <s> The entire family loved it ;  even the dog ... because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel ! <s> We loved the restaurant there ;  the Pump Room was great ;  something to please even the pickiest of our eaters . <s> We were there on a family get-away ;  but asked to see a larger  " suite "  . <s> The suites were gorgeous . <s> I can't wait to tell our friends about this place ! <s> Our next business trip to Chicago ;  we are booking at this hotel . <s> They have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service ! <s> We are definitely coming back ! <s> As a frequent traveler to Chicago ;  I generally stay at the Sutton Court ;  but thought I would try a different boutique hotel . <s> I will never stay at this hotel again . <s> The first room they brought me to  --  their standard room  --  was a glorified closet ;  leaving me absolutely claustrophobic ! <s> Actually the smallest hotel room I've been in in the U . S ! <s> I complained to the front desk ;  who then moved me to a  " premium "  room  --  still quite small ;  but manageably so . <s> The bathroom was tiny ;  without a vanity ;  making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room . <s> The location leaves much to be desired ;  as my room looked out directly onto the El  ( elevated subway - background noise )  ;  and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening . <s> I will say that the free wi-fi was great . <s> If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene ;  I'd highly recommend you take that . <s> If you want a nice room in a great location ;  check out Sutton Place hotel instead . <s> I can easily say this is one of the worst hotels I've stayed at the . <s> The receptionist up front was a snooty ;  sarcastic teenager or post teenager . <s> You can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner . <s> The room was dirty ;  stains on the carpet ;  the showerhead was moldy and rusted ;  the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches . <s> The towels had a horrible aroma . <s> The hotel is very narrow ;  so we were near a construction zone so ;  I would plan on waking up at 6 : am if you choose the Talbott . <s> The next day ;  I asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room . <s> That room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop . <s> I asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day ;  if were not out by noon . <s> I had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm . <s> Please stay away from this hotel ;  I think a Holiday Inn would be better . <s> Andrew F .  Gulli <s> I am so glad I decided to stay at the Intercontinental Chicago for my first trip to the city . <s> The staff is very attentive ;  I felt like I was the only person they had to take care of ! <s> The location is great ;  right on the Magnificent Mile and so close to major attractions . <s> My suite was well appointed and very clean . <s> I even looked behind some furniture for dust and couldn't find any . <s> The hotel is very luxurious . <s> The sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable . <s> The next time I travel to Chicago ;  I will definitely stay at the Intercontinental again . <s> I have to say that the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is a cool place to stay . <s> When I first got there ;  getting checked in was very fast . <s> The lady at the counter was nice and well spoken . <s> The bellhop had out bags into the room very fast . <s> The room was very hip and cool . <s> There was musical items all over the place . <s> I really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom . <s> After being in the room a few minutes ;  I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room . <s> They also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room . <s> I needed some things shipped while I was there ;  which they had supplies to help me with that . <s> After getting some work done ;  I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around . <s> They gave me information for 3 awesome places . <s> I left and came back after having a night out on the town . <s> They were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it . <s> I had more than pizza that night if you get my drift . <s> When I got back to my room ;  the bed was so comfortable . <s> I feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep . <s> In the morning I order breakfast ;  which was really a Philly cheese steak . <s> They will make anything you want anytime of day . <s> I checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed . <s> Thank You Hard Rock ;  You Rock ! <s> We booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes . <s> I was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at The Knickerbocker-as I had stayed when I was younger . <s> We reserved a King Non-Smoker . <s> Upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a Smoking room . <s> When argued they stated  " well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority "  . <s> As we entered the room I noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on . <s> We called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light . <s> Later that eveing as I took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels . <s> Also ;  I must add the room reaked of smoke . <s> The next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems ;  he told us the total and had not concern of our issues . <s> We also checked in our bags for the day ;  and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day . <s> We realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out . <s> STAY AWAY-even if you get a good deal !  ! <s> This review has two parts . <s>  . <s>  . I advise reading both . <s> Chapter One :  The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating . <s> The room was nice and clean as well . <s> I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff . <s> This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront ;  or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North . <s> Very easy  ( one block )  walk from the subway  ( Red line )  . <s> The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial . <s> Not just muffins and coffee . <s> You can have a complete breakfast here if you want . <s> And ;  even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient . <s> I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location ;  the room ;  and the staff . <s> Chapter Two :  The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival . <s> The rate was quoted to me as  $ 159 per night for four nights . <s> When the confirmation was emailed to me ;  it was incorrect by over  $ 300 . <s> I immediately called the hotel . <s> They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount . <s> I did receive the corrected confirmation email . <s>  . <s>  . All done ? <s> NO . <s> One week later ;  my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged . <s> I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve . <s> When I explained the error ;  I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations ;  and told  " That's not my problem . <s> I can't help you "  . <s>  . <s>  . <s> and then told that I have to pay the higher amount . <s> Excuse ME ? <s> Now ;  I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance . <s> After a few left messages ;  I get the general manager to call me back ;  and discuss the issue . <s> After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with ;  he assures me that he will credit the account immediately . <s> I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc . <s>  . <s>  . <s> One week later ;  still no credit . <s> So ;  I call the general manager again . <s> Oh ;  this might take up to 72 hours to process ;  I am told . <s> So ;  please give it another week . <s> Another week passes ;  still no credit . <s> So another call to the manager . <s> I am told now that the credit HAS been processed ;  and he even sends me an email confirming our  " agreement "  for the credit ;  just to appease me . <s> Another week passes . <s> Still ;  not seeing that credit that was  " definitely processed "  a week ago . <s> Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago . <s> I told him I will be arriving ;  and at this point ;  I want to see him personally ;  and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there . <s> Remember ;  we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved . <s> I arrive at the hotel ;  and to make a long story short ;  the general manager was NEVER available to see me ;  nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me . <s> The only person I spoke face to face with ;  was the assistant general manager . <s> He was completely unconcerned with my situation ;  and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of  " you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said' "  . <s>  . <s>  . <s> WHAT ?  ?  ?  ? <s> Today ;  my trip is over ;  and I have flown back home . <s> I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT !  !  ! <s> I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service ;  and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point . <s> Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel . <s> I haven't actually stayed at this hotel- yet- but am already disappointed in their customer service . <s> I visit Chicago quite often and usually stay at the InterContinental ;  but yesterday I read some online articles advertising The James Hotel's  " Cyber Monday Special "  . <s> The promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website ;  the hotel will match that amount in  " James Credits "  that can be used toward your stay . <s> None of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits . <s> My next trip to Chicago is in April ;  so I thought I'd give The James a try . <s> I travel frequently with my pet and I've heard they have a very liberal pet-policy . <s> So today I went online and bought a  $ 500 certificate . <s> Me ;  having the one track mind that I do ;  somehow missed the part about the credits expiring March 31 ;  2010 . <s> I realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament . <s> I said I couldn't be in Chicago until April  ( I'm overseas on business until then )  ;  and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month ;  or it not ;  refund my gift certificate purchase . <s> I had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadn't even recieved my email confirmation yet . <s> Most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period . <s> The girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me- basically saying  " too bad ;  it's your problem now "  . <s> She didn't even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all . <s> So now that I know this is the kind of service I can expect from The James ;  I might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel ;  or try Hotel Monaco . <s> I hear they have great service and are good with pets too . <s> This hotel is the best hotel ever in my opinion ;  and I really enjoy everything thing about it and I also have many different reasons why I like this hotel . <s> From the entrance to every details on the inside all the way up to the rooms ;  everything seems to pocess some kind of style to it and not forgetting such a modern feel it has . <s> I completely am astonished by this building and if I had to pick one to compare with this one I really would go for this one . <s> It's like a person would have to see it to believe . <s> It has a lot of modern designs . <s> Thank you and this is my review and it's real . <s> Hard Rock Chicago -  We stayed here â€“ in one of the Deluxe King Rooms - last May ;  on the recommendations of some friends when visiting Chicago ;  and we had a great time . <s> Rooms were stylish ;  and very cool . <s> Different from most other hotels ;  so if you like Rock music and that kind of lifestyle it might be for you . <s> Rooms were clean ;  and staff was efficient . <s> Food was good . <s> Only real problem was that with such a steep price ;  having such expensive parking and wi-fi seemed a little much . <s> Be sure to rent the Fender guitars ;  if you have some musical talent . <s> That is free ;  and for somebody like me who only has a cheap nothing guitar at home ;  it honestly may have been the highlight of the trip . <s> Spent way too much time just fiddling around with the guitar in the room . <s> Firtly they took  $ 372 off my card ;  even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night . <s> They had no business taking the money off of my card . <s> So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake . <s> It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back . <s> Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel . <s> When I looked a week later ;  they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate ;  so two of my friends didn't come to the trip away . <s> Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound . <s> After about 8 phone calls over 5 months  ( each saying they would )  they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 . <s> Overall ;  the hotel was nice and in a nice location ;  but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems . <s> I arrived at the hotel 15 minutes prior to check in time as they recommend . <s> When I get there I noticed that there is a couple and two other people waiting in line to check in . <s> Ten minutes later after standing there with my suitcase ;  the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software . <s> She told us to wait until the computers booted back up . <s> I asked if I could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they couldn't activate the cards . <s> Finally another 20 minutes later the computers were up and I finally got my room . <s> Wheres the  " luxury "  in waiting 35 minutes for a room ? <s> They also need to change the name of the hotel because their service did not leave me  " allegro . <s>  "  <s> Hilton Chicago -  " Complimentary WiFi . <s>  "  Yeah there's internet ;  if you can even call it that . <s> When it takes five minutes to load google ;  I wonder how long it will take to access your emails ? <s> I don't know ;  because I gave up trying . <s> Then I went to front desk and asked if there was any option of a paid faster internet and apparently there wasn't . <s> I decided to cancel my stay then and there . <s> The lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in . <s> The only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed . <s> When we got to our room ;  we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room . <s> I am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable . <s> The walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us . <s> When we went to breakfast ;  we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived . <s> For the price they were charging ;  the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere . <s> It also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car . <s> For forty dollars a day for parking ;  we expected better . <s> I stayed at the Hilton Chicago during a recent business trip . <s> I elected to go with their Executive Suite upgrade . <s> All I can say is ;   " What upgrade ? <s>  "  It's barely anything above what you get normally . <s> And for the price I paid ;  I was expecting much better acommodations . <s> Because I arrived around 10 : 30 the night I checked in  ( delayed flight )  I did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10 . <s> I find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet . <s> Beyond that ;  it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room . <s> First it was a room mix-up ;  then it was a missing key card . <s> That was extremely frustrating as I was tired and I had a presentation to give the next morning . <s> Speaking of the next morning ;  the complimentary breakfast was a joke . <s> When I just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast ;  I'll stay at the next Super 8 I find . <s> And the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed . <s> I will not be staying at the Hilton Chicago every again even though I frequent Chicago . <s> This tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot . <s> ï»¿Amalfi Hotel Chicago-I recently stayed there for 2 but really HATE it ! <s> It is very pricey with 150 dollars a night ;  but only provides 50-dollar worth of quality . <s> The neighborhood is so noisy that I could hardly fall asleep at night . <s> Front desk never answered phone calls and they only cleaned my room when I requested them to do so . <s> Will never book the hotel again . <s> My friends and I were in Chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood . <s> Well we came across the Hotel Allegro and immediately fell in love ! <s> Everything from the colors ;  the staff ;  the architecture ;  and the pricing were AMAZING ! <s> We couldn't have found a better hotel . <s> The service was impeccable .. talk about a 5 star hotel for someone with a 2 star budget ! <s> My friends and I plan on staying here next year when we return .. <s> I can't wait until then ! <s> The Talbott is definitely not worth the price you pay . <s> I was really looking forward to staying here since it was recently renovated  &  was in a good location . <s> Unfortunately ;  it just didn't live up to the hype . <s>  " Recently renovated "  apparently means it was redone in the last decade ;  not the last year . <s> It was just very tired-looking . <s> Also very disappointing was the food ;  and the service was hit or miss . <s> I expected better from a hotel of this caliber . <s> Bottom line ;  there are better places with better value . <s> Stay elsewhere . <s> October 3rd ;  2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 . <s> The hotel is VERY modern . <s> The room was immaculate ;  but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA . <s> It was chipped in many places . <s> The light switches were difficult to find ;  and the HVAC made noise . <s> However ;  the bed was wonderful . <s> The bathroom was large and well maintained . <s> Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted . <s> The restaurant was small . <s> You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo . <s> If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel . <s> However ;  after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel . <s> Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full . <s> When we checked in ;  we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals . <s> Upon returning home ;  we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it . <s> This reduced the line of credit ;  and it took several days to be removed from the card . <s> Great location ! <s> Reasonable value . <s> If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon . <s> I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago ;  IL ;  and boy was I surprised . <s> The hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious . <s> In fact ;  the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating . <s> As if this were not enough ;  the bathroom of my room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the  " fresh "  towels . <s> Towards the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls . <s> I recently stayed at the Affina Chicago hotel and was really dissappointed . <s> When I arrived ;  the desk clerk was really slow checking me in . <s> I feel like turtles could have checked me in faster . <s> I was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor . <s> The elevator ride seemed to take forever . <s> I arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great ;  but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table . <s> I figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it . <s> I went to the C-House for supper that evening and I had to wait for what seemed like forever . <s> The meal was good ;  but my waitress was very uptight . <s> On my way back to my room ;  I asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 AM the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up . <s> It would have been nice to actually get it though . <s> The next morning I surprisingly work up at 7 : 18 AM and realized that I had not received a wake up call . <s> I was very upset and let them know . <s> Overall this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given . <s> For the price ;  quality and ratings the Affina Chicago hotel has been given ;  I would expect better service . <s> My husband and I decided to plan a romantic get-away for our one year anniversary when we stumbled upon the Talbott Hotel in Chicago . <s> We decided to book the  " Personally Yours Romance Package "  for our stay . <s> When we arrived at the hotel ;  the staff was very friendly and approachable . <s> The personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch . <s> Each night ;  we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed . <s> The personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and I to see a Chicago Cubs baseball game . <s> I would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away . <s> A friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday . <s> The hotel at first glance was very nice and charming . <s> But ;  We quickly found out that was not the case . <s> Our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in . <s> The bathroom was filthy ;  it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks !  ! <s> There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror . <s> There were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room . <s> We immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly ;  unkempt room . <s> The women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling  " was not smoke "  because that is not permitted in the hotel . <s> We were also told that room was cleaned that day . <s> After several minutes of arguing with her and a manager ;  we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time . <s> WE had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us . <s> The food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced . <s> Our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there . <s> All the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests . <s> I will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one . <s> The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was everything you could ask for in a hotel . <s> It was meticulously clean ;  very orderly ;  but still perfectly warm and comforting . <s> The rooms are very big and spacious ;  and the beds are so soft ;  it's like heaven ! <s> I didn't test out the room service ;  but I'm sure it would be just like everything else ...  perfect ! The hotel staff are just so nice . <s> There was a spectacular view from my room ;  and looking out over the city at night is so magical . <s> There are resturants that are easy to access from the hotel ;  and I especially recommend Shula's Steak House . <s> Overall ;  I had a fantastic stay at The Sheraton Hotel ;  and I would definitely stay there again ! <s> Having traveled to Chicago on business once before ;  I was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip . <s> After some research ;  I decided that the Palmer House Hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay . <s> And ;  in a way ;  it was perfect  --  perfectly awful . <s> After reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotel's website ;  I was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary . <s> However ;  my standard guest room ;  which the hotel's website describes as  " deluxe ;  "  was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms I had stayed in at budget chain hotels ;  not pricier historic hotels ;  such as this one . <s> The carpeting looked dingy ;  so I had to wear shoes or slippers any time I walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning  --  or the horrendous view of a brick wall that I had from my window . <s> In addition ;  the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long . <s> Everything cost extra ;  including the gym ;  the pool and the spa ;  and the restaurant prices were outrageous . <s> This hotel is overpriced ;  overrated and definitely subpar . <s> I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy . <s> My stay at the Hotel Monaco recently was fantastic . <s> We got a very reasonable price for our stay  ( especially since we were a AAA member )  ;  and there was plenty of perks to utilize ;  in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few . <s> Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that ;  upon request ;  the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room . <s> How cool is that ! <s> The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable . <s> I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area . <s> My three night stay at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect way to end a weekend . <s> The hotel has a classy but warm atmosphere with color tones that please the mind and soothe the eyes . <s> The staff was ready to help at any notice and always greeted you with a cheerful smile . <s> The mySpa was the getaway of a life time . <s> My only complaint would be that the bed covers were a bit too stiff as they were new and clean but the softness of the bed whisked me away to a deep slumber in no time . <s> Well worth the money and I know my next stay will be much longer . <s> The location of the hotel is great ;  right on the river and Michigan Ave . <s> Almost everything is within walking distance . <s> At the price ;  though ;  and given the 4 star hotel ;  we expected better walls . <s> Our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors . <s> The sound from both rooms came in loud and clear . <s> We heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone  ( he clearly wasn't speaking loudly )  ;  and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk . <s> We asked them to be quiet  ( I shouldn't have expected that to work with some young drunks )  then called security ;  but they did nothing . <s> I was completely annoyed with the noise ;  especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one . <s> Unless you are in Chicago to party ;  get drunk ;  and not get any sleep ;  I wouldn't stay here . <s> I was on a business trip to Chicago a while back and I had the unfortunate luck of staying at the InterContinental Chicago Hotel . <s> I say unfortunate  ;  because from the first moment I walked in my experience was poor . <s> The front desk made me wait a very long time and I had to resolve an issue with my reservation . <s> My receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that I supply a personal credit card for the room . <s> I understand their precautions but I travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation . <s> Once that was all taken care of  ( several phone calls later )  I was taken up to my room . <s> It was nice and I was glad to finally be there ;  but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip ;  even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room . <s> I was very happy I only had to stay there two night because after my run in with the front desk I got the impression that no one wanted to deal with me . <s> I will hopefully not be staying there again ;  and will suggest that it be avoided by all . <s> Homewood Suites is a Hilton Group Hotel located in downtown Chicago . <s> Though close to many sights ;  when we visited there was extensive construction going on along Michigan Avenue ;  so every morning we were awakened right at 8 am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers . <s> We reserved the basic suite . <s> Though we arrived at 5 pm ;  well past check-in time ;  our room was not ready for 30 minutes . <s> The management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience . <s> Once the suite was ready ;  it was nice . <s> But then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom . <s> We were relocated to another room with apologies ;  but again ;  no offer of compensation for the trouble . <s> Once we were finally settled ;  the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer . <s> The food was okay ;  but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point . <s> The staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service . <s> We though it was a good idea since we were already so tired . <s> Unfortunately ;  it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected . <s> All in all we were disappointed with our experience at Homewood suites . <s> We understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable . <s> I would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting Chicago . <s> swissotel chicago - Stayed in a corner king room overlooking the city . <s> The view was great ;  the room was clean and comfortable ;  and the bathroom was so clean that it looked new . <s> They did a good job decorating the place ;  too ;  I really like the modern style and decor . <s> The only qualm I had was that for the price ;  I expected the room to be more spacious . <s> My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown Chicago and do all the touristy things ;  shop the Magnificient Mile ;  see Shedd aquarium ;  go to the museum of Science and Industry . <s> Homewood Suites was conveniently located near all of these things . <s> It was a luxurious treat of a weekend ! <s> We even swam in their rooftop indoor pool . <s> It was also nice to have the amenities of a suite ;  so we could prepare our own meals some days . <s> The staff was friendly and courteous  ( they even gave me an extra pillow on request ! <s>  )  and we would definitely stay there again . <s> Having stayed at the excellent Affinia chain in NY ;  I had very high expectations . <s> When I saw the Trip Advisor rating ;  I immediately booked . <s> What a huge disappointment :   --  The quality Simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap ;  foam pillows  --  the kind they sell in the store for  $ 4 . <s> You cannot sleep on these  --  The windows are so thin ;  you can hear the buzzing from walk / don't walk sign on Superior below . <s>  --  The walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked ;  I was awaken around midnight ;  my room engulfed in smoke odor . <s> A call downstairs yielded no results  --  There are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood ;  the desk chair was full of loose threads  --  The water flow is very weak ;  but the towels are nice  --  There are unpainted floorboards ;  the kind you find in Day's Inn  --  They charge for internet service The tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like . <s> The sign outside is also a banner . <s> Having stayed all over the U . S .  ;  you are better off at Red Roof  --  this is really an embarassment for the Affinia chain . <s> Wait until they complete the renovations in 2008 . <s> I did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand . <s> Good heart ;  but the problems are not fixable . <s> I'd been searching for a cool ;  non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend . <s> I thought I'd found a winner in the Affinia ...  SOO disappointed !  ! <s> In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults ;  we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed . <s> What ?  ! <s> I was floored ;  but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride ;  was too tired to make a fuss . <s> We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night ;  so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple . <s> I was told that room service would call ME back to take my order ... and nothing happened . <s> I didn't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs . <s> Nothing special ;  entree ;  dessert and NAB for two still came out to  $ * ... I am no hayseed ;  I'm WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago ;  but this just wasn't worth it . <s> Our room was by the elevator w /  parking garage view ... the bathroom was tiny ;  shower curtain was stained ;  funky toilet seat / lid ;  and the vanity featured that  " rude awakening "  lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms ;  i . e . <s>  ;   " Holy crap ;  have I looked that bad this whole time ?  ! <s>  "  If you're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker ;  they charge for their chintzy coffees  ( I don't use these ;  but ...  come on )  . <s> Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar ;  but weak drinks ...  That night ;  our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms . <s> But the Marathon was that weekend ;  the hotel was so busy I didn't want to be a pest . <s> I can't believe I was so impressed with this place online . <s> Next time I'll happily pay more to stay someplace that's actually a treat . <s> The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was an awesome place to stay . <s> Nothing bad about it . <s> It was a great value . <s> The beds were comfortable ;  the rooms were nice and open ;  and the pool was great . <s> Food was GREAT ! <s> My family and I loved staying here ! <s> Would recommend to everyone I know . <s> Swissotel continues to be a *yawn* As previous posters state ;  punching in your floor is ridiculous . <s> On the other hand ;  technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators  ( but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me ;  why change )  ? <s> In any case ;  I want to take a nice hot soak and -- guess what -- they are having water problems ...  SOOOOO disappointed . <s> Hopefully I don't get bug bitten this time  ( checked under the sheets )  . <s> Sadly ;  due to my company's deal ;  I think I have to stay here again next year *sigh* ... but so far they are batting 1 star ....   --  --  --  --  --  --  --  Oh boy ;  it must be my luck ... or rather this hotel is just run down . <s> I had to swap room FOUR TIMES . <s> And that's for a Thurs nite-Sunday morning stay . <s> My first room had no hot water so I had to switch rooms . <s> They gave me the key to the 2nd room ;  which happened to be occupied . <s> Luckily the occupants had their security latch on ;  so there wasn't any embarrassing moment . <s> My third room was fine for 2 nights but then today  ( just now )  I had to move because of water leakage  ( above my room and below my room )  . <s> BOY ;  talk about an awful hotel  ( or my just awful luck ?  ?  ?  ? <s> Maybe it's karma since I wrote a bad review last year ;  and continue to write one ... but it's the TRUTH )  . <s> Oh ;  also last year may not have been bed bugs . <s> I have checked the room and it looks bug free but I STILL get these itchy patches on my leg . <s> Perhaps it is something in the sheets ... or the air / HVAC ....  in any case ;  despite the decent staff ;  it is a ONE at best  ( 0 for hotel ;  1 for the still nice service -- since it's not their fault ....  )  All I can say is  ... THANK GOODNESS MY COMPANY WON " T HOLD THE CONFERENCE IN CHICAGO NEXT YEAR ;  or AT LEAST AT THIS HOTEL !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! <s> I recently stayed here for the Chicago triathlon . <s> This was my third stay at this hotel . <s> I have not had any issues until this visit . <s> After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room . <s> While getting out of bed I was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet . <s> I must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because I found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards . <s> I had not noticed it before so I was very disgusted . <s> We notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped . <s> We returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor . <s> After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no reply from the hotel . <s> Considering the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably . <s> Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago . <s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - I couldn't stand the Hard Rock Hotel . <s> The problem isn't the rooms per se . <s> They are pretty attractively layed out  ( as the hotel website endlessly repeats )  ;  and my room had an excellent view through the windows . <s> They even remembered to position the bed so that the light from the windows doesn't shine right in your eyes in the morning ;  which I always look for as curtains never completely block out the light . <s> The bathroom in my room also didn't point towards the bed ;  so when my wife used it in the middle of the night the light didn't wake me up . <s> Physically the rooms and the hotel generally are fine ;  the real problem comes from the stylish  " Hard Rock "  atmosphere . <s> You get a little bit of a feel for it on the website ;  but it's even worse in person . <s> Everything is just too cool and hip for words . <s> If you're like me and just want somewhere quiet to sleep ;  stay away from this place . <s> I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago hotel for a business meeting and had an absolutely horrible experience . <s> When i arrived ;  exhausted after a series of delayed flights ;  I was told that my room was not ready . <s> Not ready at 5pm ;  are you kidding me ! <s> After waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes I was finally called over to the desk only to be told my king room was changed to a room with two queen beds ;  fine ;  whatever . <s> I get up to my room and unload all of my bags only to find my a / c doesn't work . <s> I call down to the desk and the clerk tells me that they are sold out and there is no where to move me but she could discount my rooms  $ 20 . <s> No apology . <s> Nothing . <s> Im exhausted and deal with my 80+ degree room . <s> When I went to check out the next morning I find out no one even bothered to apply the discount . <s> Again ;  no apology . <s> I have never received such poor customer service in my life and will not be comming back . <s> We have just returned from a week at the James Chicago . <s> The hotel is fabulous ;  very chic and chilled . <s> The service is beyond compare . <s> Check in and out were swift and painless . <s> The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay . <s> The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents . <s> We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city . <s> The room  ( a deluxe king )  was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies ;  hairdryer ;  safe ;  tv ;  robes  &  slippers ;  a very interesting selection of minibar items  ( one of which was a real surprise ! <s>  )  including crisps / snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella ! <s> We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area . <s> The ipod dock / CD / radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv . <s> The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day's activities from our bedroom . <s> We were so busy touring around the city we didn't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab . <s> The bar / lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more . <s> Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available . <s> The barman mixes a mean mohito  ! <s> This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e . g . <s> The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they're away from home on business . <s> Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends . <s> Next visit to Chicago I'll definitely be staying here and wouldn't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards . <s> Here are my experiences :  - Had three rooms reserved ;  when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room assignments ;  gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - Could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty  ( we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys )  - In room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - When we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room . <s> - When we received our bills ;  the credit card assignments were still wrong . <s> I stay at  " economy "  hotels a lot and I have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one . <s> This hotel should do Chicago a service and just close its doors . <s> Due to this experience ;  I will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad . <s> I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online . <s> However ;  my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations . <s> When I arrived ;  well over an hour of check in time ;  I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in . <s> The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs ;  and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd ;  there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down  ( after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue )  . <s> As I am a fairly light sleeper ;  I woke up several times throughout the night . <s> I would recommend bringing earplugs if you're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep . <s> Overall the hotel looked very nice ;  but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room . <s> Rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see . <s> The room we had at almost  $ 400 a night was dingy and small . <s> Don't mistakingly think the Hard Rock Cafe is there ;  it isn't . <s> They have a Chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items . <s> The room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods . <s> When my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the Manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasn't a choice . <s> The Rolled Roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again ;  we called the Manager who did get it to us . <s> The staff did appear friendly ;  although housekeeping totally disregarded our 'do not disturb' sign and would call us on the phone . <s> Don't make the mistake of staying here but if you do ;  walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is  $ 3 plus 19 %  gratuity . <s> We ended up having to order delivery food brought to us . <s> This is the most overpriced ;  over rated and dingy hotel we've ever stayed in . <s> Taxi to airport is  $ 40 . <s> Ok ;  so first trip to chicago and I was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location ;  finally I decided on the CONRAD and wath a good experience i had ;  I booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor ;  view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had ;  room is nice ;  bath was all appliances and good size ;  good plasma tv ;  free internet ;  we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food ! <s> so overall and for the price aroufn 220 It was a great surprise ;  the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel <s> Well located and well staffed . <s> The Amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay . <s> It lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by . <s> Free continental breakfast and evening cocktail . <s> First stepping foot on the hotel propety I could tell it was a negative place ;  Seeing as how there was what apperd to me to be Vice Lords all aroung the property . <s> Not that i have a personal problem or affelated with another gang ;  It's just the way they was acting ;  drinking the hotels cheepest wine ;  they could of been there for securaty purpouses like the hell's angels was to some concerts . <s> Walking in the hotel i oder hit me . <s> It smelled like a cretan type of burning wood that i have smelled ;  only later to find out it was the smell of rock cocine . <s> I looked at the pool only to find there was no watter and scateborders all around the place . <s> Me being a high class bizness man ;  I decided to leave . <s> When I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago ;  I immediately went to their website to check them out . <s> What I found there was decent ;  nothing really stood out . <s> It wasn't until I actually went there that my eyes were opened . <s> The amazing customer service I received there was exceptional . <s> Every whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly . <s> The room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day . <s> When I asked about more towels ;  the maids were happy to help me out . <s> If I were ever to be in that area again ;  I know exactly where I'm staying ;  the Swissotel . <s> I stayed here August 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel . <s> The price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on Michigan Avenue . <s> The front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities . <s> The John Entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch . <s> Any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago really helped me accomplish just that ! <s> Great hotel ! <s> Went to see the Museum of Contemporary Art which was great ;  but this hotel almost had it beat ! <s> The rooms  ( and even halls )  are very beautifully done . <s> Great service too . <s> A+ <s> Don't stay here ! <s> My family and I stayed here for a weekend trip . <s> The staff were rude and acted like we were bothering them . <s> The rooms looked nice in photographs but when we got there our room looked like it hadn't been dusted in ages . <s> Overall bad service and not worth the money . <s> The Omni Chicago Hotel I am a business woman who travels a great deal out of a month ;  therefore ;  my accommodations must meet the highest standards . <s> I was booked for a stay at The Omni Chicago Hotel ;  located in what is referred to as ' The Magnificent Mile ' in the greater Chicago area . <s> ' Magnificent ' ;  it was ! <s> The beautifully red-bricked sky scraper was indeed a breath- taking sight and upon entrance ;  I had a felling of warmth from the very hospitable welcoming staff . <s> I was impressed with the hotels special rates offered during prime business hours and the guest rooms ranged everything from ' The Presidential Suite to The Governors Suite ' . <s> I accepted a more humble room as I would not need to spend very much time there during the day . <s> I did stay inside most nights and the amenities were more than satisfactory . <s> I enjoyed the very spacious exercise room and afterwards ;  I would take a quick dip in the pool . <s> I toured the hotel as my niece is planning her wedding and just so happens to live close to the hotel . <s> The ' Chagall Ballroom ' ;  was elegant enough for such an occasion and reeked of pure luxury . <s> I was given very adequate maps and directions to and from as my business was conducted throughout the city . <s> That was a life saver . <s> All in all ;  my experience was more than favorable and I would definitely stay there again along with recommending it to anyone . <s> Link - http :  /  / www . omnihotels . com / FindAHotel / Chicago . aspx  Hotel Name - Omni Hotels  Positive Deception -  The locality of Hotel is really great ! <s> Right in the heart of city within walking distance to malls and theatre is a plus . <s> The rooms are very clean and staff is well trained and extremely helpful . <s> We had a family reunion in Chicago and the place couldn't have been more pleasant . <s> Although in heart of city ;  we could easily find parking space at the hotel valet parking . <s> The food was really amazing and the cuisine  we were served had authentic spices in them . <s> We had pets along with us and they were also really nicely taken care of . <s> However the only disappointment was when I did a checkout . <s> We were charged for the internet usage for not being member of hotel loyalty member group . <s> Besides this everything certainly exceeded my expectation . <s> I couldn't have asked for anything more and would definitely visit again . <s> I highly recommend the hotel to anyone visiting Chicago . <s> The Conrad Hotel is a beautiful hotel . <s> Our room was perfect and beautiful in every way . <s> I was very impressed  ( and I am hard to please and have high standards )  . <s> It was so clean ;  aesthetically pleasing ;  up to date ;  just gorgeous ! <s> I would definitely stay there again . <s> I loved it . <s> The location is superb too ;  attached to Nordstrom and Northbridge mall . <s> Can't wait to go back ! <s> I truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment ;  but my time spent at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago forced me to do so . <s> It was to be our first trip to Chicago since I was a boy so my wife and I were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel . <s> First I must say that the counter help was far less than helpful . <s> The apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service . <s> He said we had not reserved a room ;  which I had weeks earlier ;  and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that WE must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both . <s> Finally the manager arrived after I insisted on his presents . <s> He did straiten out the confusion ;  but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants . <s> I called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place . <s> We were shown to another room ;  this time to our liking . <s> From that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the Affinia had . <s> To list just a few ;  the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels ;  the food that room service brought up was cold ;  lifeless and bland ;  the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the door ;  and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and I lift the room . <s> To be blunt ;  I truly hope that the CEO of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff ;  guts the building thoroughly ;  and is publicly flogged in a downtown park . <s> WE WILL NEVER STEP THROUGH THE DOORS OF THE AFFINIA AGAIN . <s> Hilton Chicago - I got a rate of  $ 194 ;  more than  $ 50 cheaper than the normal rate by booking a few weeks in advance ;  but even at the normal rate of around  $ 250 ;  its still a bargain . <s> The rooms were big and comfortable with sparkling clean bathrooms . <s> The amenities were changed daily with efficient housekeeping that kept out of our way . <s> The view outside ;  even only on the twelveth floor ;  is quite stunning . <s> Plus the complimentary breakfast was actually a real meal with a huge variety of food rather than the standard milk and cereal offered pretty much everywhere else . <s> The only small complaint is the rather expensive parking at  $ 45 a day . <s> My boyfriend and I got a great last minute deal on a room here . <s> Unfortunately ;  the discounted rate mean't a discounted experience apparantly . <s> The room smelled weird like wet dogs ;  many of the furnishings were stained or cracked ;  the bed was not very comfortable ;  and the window overlooked the back of the building  ( not the nicest view )  . <s> I will say that the location was great though and staff friendly . <s> Not sure it was worth it though ;  even at the discounted rate . <s> My husband and I were really looking forward to spending our anniversary at the Conrad hotel . <s> For the price we were paying we were expecting a luxurious hotel with all the amenities unfortunately it was quite the opposite . <s> Upon arriving we were greeted by a rude and incompetent receptionist . <s> Not only could she not find our reservation due to the fact that she kept misspelling our name ;  but she refused to apologize when she finally did find them and acted as if it was our fault she couldn't spell ! <s> Our room turned out to be okay except for the stain on my pillow case which ruined the experience for me . <s> We ate at the restaurant on site and were less than impressed with the food . <s> It was alright but nothing out of this world . <s> We felt we could have gotten a better meal elsewhere . <s> All in all the Conrad was a big disappointment to both of us . <s> My husband and I were sorely disappointed in this hotel . <s> We had requested a non smoking room ;  and right off we were hit with the stinch of stale cigarettes when we opened the door . <s> The front desk was not responsive to our needs at all ;  but we did finally get moved to a new room . <s> The water pressure in the shower was hardly enough to get the shampoo out of our hair and the beds were lumpy . <s> I was very disappointed in the workout room ;  it was very small so I decided to swim laps instead ;  but when I got to the pool it didn't look like it had been maintained all week . <s> Needless to say we won't make the mistake of staying with Homewood Suites again . <s> This comes a little late as I'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months :  )  A dear friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in late October 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town . <s> This hotel is perfect ;  IMO . <s> Easy check in and check out . <s> Lovely ;  clean ;  comfortable rooms with great views of the city . <s> I know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown Chicago attractions . <s> We had dinner and went clubing with our friends around Division St ..  We had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the Hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel . <s> Parking ;  as is usual for Chicago ;  was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly  ( however ;  we left on a Sunday morning ;  not exactly a high traffic time although it was a Bears homegame day ;  so a bit busier than usual I would think )  . <s> No problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of  $ 100 through Hotwire ;  a downright steal for this area of Chicago and the quality of the hotel . <s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago - I had a really good time staying at Amalfi hotel . <s> The room is big and clean ;  and everything is so well organized . <s> At the same time ;  they supply free high speed throughtout the hotel . <s> What's more ;  they provide delicious breakfast which i likes a lot . <s> The hotel is located in downtown Chicago so it's walking distance to most of the sightseeing . <s> I will definitely stay at this hotel if I come back to Chicago in the future . <s> We stayed in the Amalfi in July 2010 ;  4th of July weekend . <s> I was very apprehensive about leaving my Diesel Ford Excursion with the valet at Amalfi . <s> It has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly . <s> I explained the procedure to the valet drivers ;  and felt like it was a complete waste of time . <s> When the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as I had instructed . <s> When I tried to start it ;  it wasn't happy ;  but did finally start . <s> I was so relieved to get it back I just wanted to leave . <s> Driving away I noticed that the top speed recorded on the GPS was 105mph !  !  ! <s>  ( previous top speed was 95mph ;  done a few days earlier driving across South Dakota )  . <s> I could just picture the flying Ferrari scene in Ferris Bueller's Day Off . <s> I couldn't imagine where in the crowded Chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast ;  though it wouldn't take long to make that happen  ( see reference to modified engine above )  . <s> A little while later we stopped for lunch and I noticed a dent in the front bumper . <s> I contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people . <s> No remedy . <s> Lesson learned . <s> Brett <s> I stayed at the Hyatt for a two nights on a business trip . <s> My room was oddly shaped to give a stunning view of the river and NBC Building . <s> Both the room and the bathroom were spotless and the room had an air purifier which ran silently . <s> The hotel was well staffed with individuals who were knowledgeable about both the hotel and the surrounding area . <s> I would not hesitate to stay here again and plan to return with my wife for a weekend . <s> I'd expect a  " luxury "  hotel to pay more attention to details . <s> The room really hadn't been thoroughly cleaned --  I found hairballs under the bed ;  the mirrors were streaked ;  etc . <s> The desk staff took forever to even acknowledge me when I was checking in ;  three of them ;  two on the phone ;  and nobody even made eye contact for 5 minutes . <s> Then ;  they gave the vaguest answers to some pretty basic questions about the neighborhood ;  you'd think they'd know where to find a Starbucks . <s> The internet was ridiculously slow the whole two days I was there . <s> I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago while in town for business ;  and enjoyed my stay very much . <s> I stayed in a room with a king bed ;  which was very comfortable . <s> The room had all the things I needed for my stay ;  which was nice . <s> The only thing is I think there was a party on my floor ;  but they quieted down quickly enough . <s> My room even had an internet connection ! <s> I also had dinner one night at the China Grill ;  and it was an amazing meal ! <s> Overall ;  I had a great stay ;  and will return next time I am in Chicago . <s> This was our second time staying here . <s> We were very much looking forward to our weekend at the Amalfi  ( based on how well the first stay was )  . <s> It turned out better than our anticipation . <s> The beds are very comfortable . <s> 2 headed showers with a large bathroom . <s> The hotel is also pleasantly quiet and easy to check-in and out . <s> Our room was near the exercise room which helped motivate us to get in an hour morning workout . <s> Then we were able to grab some complimentary fruit ;  pastries ;  juice and coffee on our floor  ( breakfast is on every floor )  . <s> No great view from our room ;  but I don't think there are great views from most any room since it is only 5 floors . <s> We didn't need to drive ;  take a cab or jump on the L the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located . <s> We easily walked to bars ;  blues clubs ;  restaurants ;  the hancock tower ;  the loop and the waterfront all from our hotel . <s> The highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour . <s> Free top-shelf drinks and wonderful meats ;  cheeses ;  peppers ;  and breads . <s> This ran from 5 : 30 to 7 : 00 ;  and was a great warm-up to a nice dinner . <s> This alone saved us a bundle in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening . <s> And an extra money-saving tip ... park at the self-park lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on Kinzie . <s> Its  $ 24 per night during the week and only  $ 6 per night on the weekends . <s> I think the hotel charges  $ 30 to  $ 40 per night to park . <s> Spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend . <s> The staff was wonderful ;  room was beautiful and location great . <s> You can take the train directly from Midway and walk one block to the hotel . <s> Very close to museums and restaurants . <s> I have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to Chicago . <s> If there is ever a Hotel you should stay at it is the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . <s> This is the most beautiful Hotel I have ever seen . <s> This Hotel has more than you will ever need or want . <s> You can pick from a room that is decorated in great taste . <s> There is a in room refreshment center ; high speed Internet ;  32 inch television  ; coffer maker with great coffee from Starbucks . <s> You could get a suite or the Presidential suite with more room than you will ever need . <s> The room is over 2000 square feet . It over looks the Chicago River . <s> There is plenty of activities with a great fitness center and a big indoor heated pool . The sauna was just wonderful . <s> If you want to sight see in the area you can walk to the Navy pier ; or Art Institute . <s> When you come back hungry you can eat at the elegant steakhouse which had some of the best food we ever ate . <s> Have a few drinks at the great bar ;  then create your own burger at the Chicago Burger Company . <s> The staff was very friendly and super helpful . <s> The Hotel was the cleanest I have ever seen . <s> I will come again and again . <s> A big thumbs up to this great Hotel . <s> For a Hilton hotel I was very unimpressed ;  the rooms are incredibly small ;  there are no refrigirator or coffee machine for coffee or tea . <s> Wifi costs an arm . <s> Plus side there is a Starbucks at the bottom ;  but only limited opening hours ;  the lobby is very nice . <s> Location is decent . <s> I had such a horrible experience when I stayed at Omni Chicago Hotel last Saturday night . <s> First of all ;  the plasma TV in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available ;  and they weren't particularly apologetic about it ;  either . <s> Secondly ;  it was supposedly a non-smoking hotel ;  but as an ex-smoker ;  I can tell that people had smoked in the room recently . <s> Additionally ;  the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels ;  which was really disappointing ;  because I was looking forward to using the pool . <s> Finally ;  check-out was supposed to be at noon . <s> At 11 : 15 am ;  the maid was knocking at the door . <s> She asked if I would be out soon ;  and I thought was very quite intrusive . <s> I will never ;  ever stay at that place again . <s> The Ambassador East Hotel is a terrible place to stay . <s> All of the rooms are old and dirty as though they haven't been cleaned or remodeled for years . <s> The hotel staff is not friendly or accomodating . <s> Do not waste your money in this crappy old hotel full of rude employees . <s> This will be the only hotel I will never forget in my life . <s> Hotel Monaco Chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice . <s> Whether if it's a King Delux Room or a Tranquility Suite ;  all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based ;  so it suits ones personality . <s> Even if you are a super sized person ;  like me with a height of 6 " 4' ;  there are special  " Tall Rooms "  just for you . <s> My days went very fast when I stayed there becuase there was so much to do there . <s> In the mornings I would do yoga from the Yoga Channel . <s> Then I would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper . <s> Before I go to a meeting ;  I would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service . <s> After I come back from the meeting ;  I would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines . <s> I just didn't want to leave that hotel ;  so I decided that the next time I come to Chicago ;  I will surely stay at Hotel Monaco Chicago . <s> I stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the Chicago Bears Fan Convention  ( Feb 27- March 1 )  . <s> The hotel is beautiful . <s> I had a Towers room . <s> I had a decent view of the city  ( Sears Tower )  . <s> The room was a little small but had two bathrooms  ( 1 King bed )  . <s> The Tower room has it's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast ;  evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day . <s> The registration /  lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks Lake Michigan . <s> The hotel was full but service was excellent . <s> The location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two  ( especially toward the El train )  . <s> We loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car . <s> I will stay here again . <s> Hilton offered a Sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay . <s> This made the cost reasonable  ( for Chicago )  . <s> However ;  the Pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired . <s> The pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink . <s> Hotel Allegro Chicago is a beautiful place . <s> I was originally dreading being in Chicago due to the fact it was all business and no play ;  but as soon as I saw the inside of the hotel I was stunned ! <s> I wasn't expecting to stay at a place that made business trip feel like a get-away vacation . <s> The service there was amazing ;  everybody was very friendly . <s> When I saw my room ;  once again my jaw almost dropped . <s> The room was fit for a king ;  the designs on the wall were so elegant . <s> The beds were extraordinarily comfy . <s> I think for my next business trip I am going to bring my wife and kids with me . <s> I give this Kimpton Hotel 5 / 5 stars ! <s> James Chicago - My visit to the James Chicago was one of the best trips I have had in the past year . <s> It is a truly â€œLuxury Liberatedâ€ kind of experience . <s> From the staff to the rooms ;  the restaurant ;  spa - the whole package is the real deal . <s> The very ambience is liberating . <s> The contemporary feel to the entire hotel - whether its the furniture or the organics or the electrics or the wall pieces in the rooms or art in the hallways ;  it is completely relaxing . <s> The food at the restaurant was just delicious . <s> The amazing part was we could watch the waiters and the chefs at work . <s> Also the rooms were very clean something to be expected of ;  in a luxury hotel ;  Iâ€™d say . <s> We had to pay separately for the valet parking and the room service and such other tiny extra stuff ;  but then ;  itâ€™s a luxury hotel - and these tiny charges are totally expected . <s> No regrets on that front . <s> The only thing that could have been better is the location . <s> It was a lot noisy during night - probably due to the hospital close by and we could hear the ambulances a lot . <s> But heck ;  one cannot expect everything right ? <s> Really satisfied . <s> A+ <s> I was going on a 3 day personal trip to Chicago ;  and I decided to indulge myself a bit this time around . <s> I chose to stay at the Talbot ;  an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown Chicago . <s> To start off ;  I was NOT pleased . <s> For the hundreds I pay a day ;  I expected an impeccable hotel . <s> First ;  the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation I had placed nearly A MONTH in advance . <s> Some customer service they claim . <s> Next ;  when I went to my room ;  I found that room service had not cleaned it at all . <s> I was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such . <s> In summary :  yes ;  it was a fancy hotel ;  yes it had nice accommodations ;  but the service I experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price . <s> I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment . <s> Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel . <s> If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesn't go down past 74 ;  the closet is 24 "  wide ;  all old / dirty brass fixtures ;  beds that are a little bigger than a twin ;  showerheads that barely put out water ;  then this is your hotel . <s> I might be spoiled by staying in Marriott's ;  but I stay in hotels 1 / 3 of the year and was severly disappionted . <s> No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again . <s> Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown – I was tricked by the pictures on their website and believed their rooms were big and clean . <s> It turns out their room is big but NOT CLEAN AT ALL . <s> The bed smells dusty and the carpet in the bedroom has these disgusting dark dots . <s> The bathroom looks old and gives me a feeling that no one lives here for a long time . <s> The hotel is in a good location ;  and maybe that’s why it is so noisy . <s> My advice :  if you want a clean and quiet place to have a good rest ;  don’t go there . <s> My husband and I stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel last weekend and I felt compelled to write a review about this wonderful hotel . <s> I have to say I was very impressed with the cleanliness and the beautiful decor of this hotel . <s> Not to mention the friendliest and most helpful staff I have ever encountered . <s> I frequently stay at hotels for business but have never had such a wonderful experience as I did at the Omni Chicago Hotel . <s> From the minute we walked in the beautiful front doors to the time of our check out we were absolutely treated like royalty . <s> This is one hotel that I would definitely rate 5 stars . <s> You can be sure ;  I will absolutely be back in the future . <s> The Palmer House Hilton is an incredible break from the real world . <s> The lobby is a throwback to the grand era of travel ;  and you can just imagine people stepping off the train with their steamer trunks . <s> The lobby is luxe and gilded ;  with soaring ceilings and is staffed with friendly ;  accommodating employees . <s> The rooms are plush ;  with each bed furnished with a Serenity Dreams topper for extra comfort . <s> The room decor is modern and sleek ;  a world from the tacky furnishings in most hotels . <s> For your convenience ;  there's a fully-stocked business center ;  pool ;  fitness room and workout area - something to accommodate the solo ;  business or family traveller . <s> James Chicago would be one of the worst hotels I have ever been to in my life ! <s> Even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic ;  its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible . <s> They gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago ! <s> I figured it was because the hotel was busy but I started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service . <s> The television was not working at all . <s> I was extremely disapointed ;  especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax . <s> Sadly ;  i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment . <s> The Wifi was a bust . <s> Absolutely nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall . <s> I am never going to James Hotel ever again ! <s> The James hotel is located close to everything in Chicago ;  the miracle mile ;  Pizza House Uno ; Rush street ;  The Water Tower everything . <s> We walked everywhere because everything was close by . <s> The rooms are very modern and a little on the small side . <s> But the bed was very comfortable ;  Very ! <s> The service is very good and the calls are answered professionally and nicely . <s> All service was very fast and through . <s> The lobby is a liitle small but that keeps the riff raff from hanging out in it ;  the bar service was good . <s> The drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar . <s> I got a great deal from leading hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over  $ 400 . 00 for a 5 star hotel that's cheap . <s> Due to the location ;  price and service I may stay there again . <s> But I think my next trip may take me to Trump's hotel in Chi Town . <s> The James is a good stay  . <s> The doorman at the hotel are Great ! <s> Always pleasent ;  with a smile and very good service . <s> Very friendly staff - and helpfull with whatever  ? <s> you may have . <s> Don't miss the wine bar and the hot chocolate bar . <s> Spacious rooms . <s> Perfect for business and for theatre guests . <s> A little quiet area during weekends . <s> My 3 nieces and I stayed here for a long weekend ;  we had a wonderful time . <s> We arrived early around 8 : 30am and they let us into our room . <s> This was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later Room was very clean as was the bathroom . <s> With 4 women we needed extra towels ;  they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered . <s> Room was also quiet ;  construction going on behind us and we never heard anything . <s> Beds comfy and so were the quilts ...  Good location for Michigan Ave .  All in all a wonderful stay . <s> Would return . <s> I booked a room at this hotel expecting great accommodations considering the price but was disappointed . <s> The room looked nice ;  but I found that there weren't any extra blankets in the closet and the heating system was dysfunctional . <s> I came back to the room after a meeting and found that it still had not been cleaned even though it was the late afternoon . <s> I asked for replacement towels and they were very late in coming . <s> I would have expected there to be a shuttle of some sort to the airport ;  especially since the website advertises the close distance . <s> Instead ;  I had to call for a taxi and was almost late for my plane because the taxi was stuck in traffic . <s> All in all ;  not the best experience at all . <s> My husband and I stayed here for New Years eve weekend . <s> This is an excellent hotel in an excellent location . <s> Hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming . <s> The rooms had the best electronics I've ever seen . <s> Loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall . <s> The hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by ;  so we avoided it too . <s> Ate at Joe's across the street - excellent seafood . <s> And you can shop til you drop without going outside ! <s> Nordstroms and four story mall is attached . <s> Lots of good  " food on the run "  places in there . <s> Loved Chicago - loved the Conrad . <s> I will go back ! <s> I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel . <s> It was my first time staying at this hotel and ;  I am sorry to say ;  it was my last time staying there . <s> One of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise . <s> The walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night I could hear my neighbors in the next room talking . <s> Although I could not quite make out the words of their conversations ;  I could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer . <s> In addition ;  I was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door ;  presumably on the way to their rooms . <s> Admittedly ;  I am a light sleeper ;  but this was ridiculous . <s> If you decide to stay here ;  I suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out . <s> When I checked mine ;  I found that I was being charged a rate higher than the one that I was supposed to be charged . <s> I had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me  ( and the front desk service is woefully slow )  and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected . <s> Finally ;  though I had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated ;  I cannot believe that statement was accurate . <s> The room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn . <s> All in all ;  I round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing . <s> Next time I will arrange to stay elsewhere . <s> i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in Chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning . <s> the girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me . <s> the room wasnt at all what i was expecting . <s> it was dingy ;  dirty ;  and just seems like an old hotel . <s> just not what i was looking for in a nice hotel . <s> seemed like the quality you'd expect from a cheap motel . <s> The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel . <s> However ;  modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks . <s> Room service is available 24 hours a day ;  but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service . <s> Two bars are located on the premises ;  which is appealing at first . <s> Once inside ;  patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy ;  of any kind . <s> The guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean ;  but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine . <s> Obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult . <s> If you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience ;  with reliable customer service ;  booking a room here is probably not a viable option . <s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - Convenient location of the hotel was the only good thing about my stay at Hard Rock . <s> Small room ;  squeaky mattress ;  uncomfortable pillows and noise from the hallway . <s> Of course ;  I didn't feel well rested at all the next morning . <s> I complained about the noise to the staff but all I got was a pair of earplugs . <s> It was definitely not worth the money to stay here . <s> I don't know why I had such horrible experience considering that it's a four star hotel ;  but I wouldn't come back here . <s> Stayed here for 3 nights for a Bridgestone / Firestone convention . <s> No complaints . <s> Room was great with a beautiful view . <s> Staff was very accommodating . <s> Had drinks and appetizers in main bar . <s> Fantastic ! <s> Great location . <s> Yes it's a huge hotel as it's used for conventions but that didn't stop it from being a great place . <s> My significant other and I recently spent 3 nights at The James and on the last day I said ;   " I wish we could stay longer "  . <s> That good ! <s> The room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door . <s> Everything is high tech . <s> Plasma TV ;  CD / Radio ;  Projection alarm clock  ( love that so much bought one today )  . <s> If you wanted room service you got it from David Burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful . <s> They even have a four legged friend menu . <s> The bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes / slippers and upscale products provided . <s> The bed was the best in a hotel ever . <s> Linens were crip ;  white and fresh . <s> Maid service twice daily with turn down service . <s> Safe in room ;  ice delivered ;  iron ;  hairdryer all top of the line . <s> The filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor . <s> Mid-century style with funky chair / ottman ;  cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home . <s> The staff was courteous and accommodating . <s> The library ;  free internet access ;  in room wifi were extras we didn't expect  . <s> Bar / lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby . <s> Funky artwork . <s> Location ;  location ;  location . <s> The best place we've ever stayed not only in Chicago . <s> Highly recommend . <s> I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby . <s> While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers . <s> When we arrived it took over an hour to check in . <s> We had requested two rooms on the same floor ;  which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival . <s> When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it . <s> Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there . <s> We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers . <s> When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in . <s> We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping . <s> We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests . <s> After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate . <s> This  " something "  never arrived . <s> We will not be making a return visit to this hotel . <s> While the housekeeping staff ;  location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative . <s> Dissapointed with my stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park . <s> When I looked at its web site I was convinced this was going to be the perfect place for my family and I to spend time in ;  when not gazing the  " sites "  in Chicago . <s> Boy was I wrong ;  When I first arrived to check in there was no one insight at the desk . <s> Finally ;  after about 20 minutes ;  I was approached with no apology for my wait . <s> While trying to check in they told me there was a mixup and the room I originally requested was occupied ;  I was given a less spacious room ;  one bed for my wife and I to share with the kids ;  and was told they would voucher my meals that day . <s> My wife and I love sushi so we figured we use it on that . <s> When we were done not only was the quality of the food mediocre but they told us the voucher would not work for the sushi bar . <s> Worst display of customer service I have ever received and will never stay there again . <s> I stayed in this hotel during a business trip ;  and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar ;  a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet . <s> Security was informed ;  but I was told that I had to wait to talk to them . <s> After about twenty minutes of waiting I was informed that if I did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident ;  despite the fact that I was a hotel guest . <s> Unfortunately I had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait . <s> Long story short ;  I no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone ;  anyone would have talked to me about it . <s> I've since been on the phone with a manager ;  who promised to call me back once she researched the incident ;  and have yet to hear back ;  despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago . <s> I expected more from this hotel . <s> I needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one . <s> First of all the prices for one night are extremely high . <s> The workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities . <s> Then i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep . <s> Also the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting . <s> The beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all . <s> Overall i am very disappointed with this hotel . <s> Stayed at the InterContinental for an entire week on business and for the most part a very elegant ;  convenient visit . <s> Stayed in the historic tower . <s> Very nice rooms ;  great view ;  attentive staff ;  convenient location just north of the Tribune Tower  &  the river ;  and nice fitness club at  $ 16 for the entire stay . <s> The only downside is I couldn't get over the feeling that I was being nickle  &  dimed :   $ 10 a day for Wi-Fi ;   $ 6 bottles of water in the room ;   $ 26 mini-bottle of wine in the fridge ;  tipping multiple staff for carrying the same bags ;  etc . <s> Their in-house restaurant Zest is Zagat rated though I'm not sure why . <s> Within a 5 minute walk there are plenty of great restaurants with much better food than Zest . <s> But ;  next time I need to be near the Loop I'd stay at the InterContinental again . <s> Great beds ;  clean rooms ;  amazing bathroom ;  nifty view ;  wonderful service ;  expensive parking  (  $ 40 ;  but it's Chicago )  ;  speedy in and out . <s> Very European in sensibility and amenities ;  but with air conditioning ! <s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago Hotel offered PDA or kiosk check-in which was great . <s> They also offer hypo-allergenic rooms with air purification systems which gave us a much more delightful stay . <s> We enjoyed the 24 / 7 stay fit gym ;  iHome stereo with iPod docking station ;  flat screen tv with video on demand and Wi-Fi . <s> Concierge staff was very helpful with assisting us with finding excellent award winning dining and popular attractions in the area . <s> We enjoyed our stay and will definetly return to this hotel in the future for family and business trips . <s> Awesome hotel ;  our room overlooked Michigan Ave and we could see the river . <s> Very stylish ;  trendy room and hotel . <s> Lacked a bit in amenities  ( pool ;  etc )  but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel . <s> Booked it thought Hotwire for  $ 99 which was awesome value . <s> On a recent business trip to Chicago ;  I had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel . <s> Upon entrance ;  the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice . <s> However ;  as I approached the check in counter ;  the woman working there was very terse and rude to me . <s> They had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when I asked about changing it ;  I was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me . <s> After a half hour ;  I finally received the correct room . <s> The linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality ;  they were scratchy and had a musty smell . <s> Also ;  the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket  ( including a condom )  and there was no shampoo . <s> Also ;  I had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee . <s> When I called the front desk to ask for some ;  they told be it was not free and would I like to charge the coffee to my account . <s> I found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there . <s> I never write these reviews ;  but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the  # 1 2008 travelers choice . <s> Terrible Service ;  Lazy Doormen / bellmen / concierge / valet ;  Lack of Respect ;  allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints ;  Phantom charges to room ;  front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus . <s> The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son ;  and the doorman watched on doing nothing . <s> Me and my girlfriend are young ;  look young in how we dress ;  but in all honesty make more money than most ... and we were treated like cheap poor kids . <s> I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up ;  the concierge exclaimed that ;   " You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr . <s> Blank ? <s>  "  Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star  $ 200 / person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young ? <s> Very Dissapointed . <s> Very nice looking ;  comfortable beds ;  great room service ;  contemporary ;  younger crowd ;  but service was terrible . <s> Stayed here for 4 nights in Apri . <s> From check in the stay was perfect all round ;  staff were so helpfuly and friendly especially Chris and Scott . <s> The location couldn't be better right on Michigan Avenue so easy access to everything . <s> Room was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day . <s> Will definately recommend it to friends and family . <s> My husband and I visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park for our honeymoon . <s> The customer service was amazing . <s> From the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing . <s> These people were proficient ;  respectful and very thoughtful . <s> The Fairmont had a lounge ;  a wine room ;  a bar and a restaurant . <s> I couldn't decide where I wanted to go first ! <s> After we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room ... <s> It was totally delicious . <s> We also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon ! <s> Then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa ;  once again excellent !  ! <s> Everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time . <s> We stayed in the gold room . <s> Although it was a little bit smaller than I thought it would be I was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows . <s> My husband and I relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city . <s> It was a wonderful experience that I will never forget . <s> Four thumbs up ! <s> I recently stayed at the Amalfi Chicago with my wife on a business trip . <s> We decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded . <s> We enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city . <s> The individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service . <s> The Amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more . <s> Our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site . <s> The hotel's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses . <s> Lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable . <s> Breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt . <s> Being of European descent ;  I enjoyed the croissants ;  whole grain muffins ;  real butter and marmalade . <s> We also brought along our Standard Poodle ;  Sterling ;  and the Amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family . <s> We purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed Sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings . <s> Sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling  " at home "  while away . <s> For pet lovers this is a big plus . <s> Finally ;  transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal . <s> This allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this ;  another appreciated bonus of our stay . <s> Thank you Amalfi for a superb experience . <s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago hotel was a delight to stay at . <s> I've never been to Chicago before ;  but the location was fantastic . <s> They had all sorts of different rooms ;  from non-smoking to smoking to hypo-allergenic rooms . <s> I've never seen so many options for rooms . <s> The room I stayed in was well worth the nightly price . <s> The location was so close to all the activities my husband and I had planned for our vacation . <s> We have never been treated so much like royalty than at the Chicago Hyatt Regency . <s> Conrad Chicago - Stayed at the Conrad Chicago recently with my family . <s> No real complaints about the hotel itself - room was a good size ;  good decor ;  nice and clean  ( although when you're paying over  $ 250 a night ;  you wouldn't expect anything less . <s>  )  The staff ;  however ;  left a lot to be desired . <s> Had interactions with several staff members who should have been a lot more catering to our needs since they're working in the service industry for such an upscale hotel . <s> For example ;  one morning ;  the maid who serviced our room knocked on our door a little before we were getting ready to leave for the day . <s> We told her we would be leaving soon and she could come back in 15 or so minutes . <s> Went to the Lincoln Park Zoo for the day . <s> Returned several hours later ;  and the maid was just starting to service our room ! <s> We had to go and sit in the lobby for 20 minutes ;  waiting for her to finish . <s> The worst was when we voiced our complaints to the front desk ;  they didn't seem concerned at all ;  and basically ignored what we were saying . <s> Next time we're in Chicago ;  we'll be trying a different hotel . <s> I recently stayed in a room at the trendy Talbott Hotel . <s> It looked nice on the outside so I decided to them a whirl . <s> As soon as I walked in I noticed that there weren't alot of hotel employees . <s> Usually ;  the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand . <s> I was tired and I needed a nice room so as I approached the front desk I noticed something odd . <s> Food was sitting out right in front of the front desk . <s> People were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush . <s> Crumbs everywhere especially where I was suppose to exchange cash and room keys . <s> Let's just say it wasn't professional . <s> The room was average and the bathroom didn't carry the kinds of brands I would have liked to see . <s> No Wi-Fi connection and I had to walk down the hall for ice . <s> Talk about lack of customer service . <s> All in all ;  the stay was sub-par and nothing special . <s> I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers for three days while I was in Chicago on business . <s> This was quite possibly the best hotel experience that I have ever had ;  which says a lot considering the fact that I stay in hotels quite frequently . <s> The staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating . <s> They made sure that I had absolutely everything that I could want or need . <s> Their friendliness came across in a very genuine manner ;  not fake or forced like some employees can be . <s> The room itself was to die for . <s> The bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept . <s> I cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding ! <s> Because of the mattress and bedding ;  I got the best three nights of sleep I've ever had . <s> The views of downtown Chicago were absolutely amazing from my room . <s> The way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to Chicago . <s> The food was amazing also . <s> I made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel's restaurants and visit the bar while I was there . <s> My favorite restaurant of the three was Shula's Steak House . <s> The Chi Bar ;  the hotel's bar ;  was amazingly designed and the drinks were great . <s> All in all ;  i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5 . <s> There is nowhere else in downtown Chicago that compares to the Sheraton . <s> Conrad Chicago - I stayed at the Conrad Chicago last month when I was in town for a business trip . <s> The room was a good size ;  and I loved the view of the city at night from my window . <s> Also it was really nice having the free internet access from my room - I get so annoyed when hotels charge you extra for it . <s> I didn't have a chance to use the fitness center ;  but I did walk by it ;  and it seemed bigger than most hotels . <s> Also open 24 / 7 which is nice . <s> Overall ;  don't really have any complaints . <s> Definitely will consider staying here next time I'm in Chicago ;  especially if I can get a good deal ! <s> took a weekend trip with my wife . <s> got a great rate with valet included ;  paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room . <s> staff was nice ;  workout facility was great . <s> room has current decor ;  but was starting to show some wear . <s> watch the concierge ;  she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us . <s> A friend highly recommended this hotel and we couldn't have been happier ! <s> It was wonderful ~ my husband and kids were already planning our next trip there before we had even left the hotel . <s> The kids loved the goldfish in the room and thought the window seats were the best . <s> Generally speaking ;  nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue . <s> We checked the closed with the mini bar  ( picture uploaded )  ;  so much dust ;  nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years . <s> We called in housekeeping ;  giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it . <s> Still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs . <s> later . <s> Next day moved to a renovated room ;  much better but not 5 star clean at all . <s> In addition ;  there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception ;  no wonder when just 1 / 3 of the counters is actually open . <s> Please do something about these issues its ruining everything ! <s> Our stay at the Hilton Chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure . <s> The staff was super friendly and helpful ;  the room was very clean and the location was fantastic . <s> The walking track was an especially nice touch . <s> Highly recommended ! <s> Our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly didn't spoil our 4 nights in this lovely hotel . <s> Wine tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city !  ! <s> Our goldish was called Oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room !  ! <s> All the staff were really helpful and welcoming ;  making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable . <s> Would certainly recommend this hotel . <s> Was there recently for one night for a conference . <s> Tried to check-in at 5 : 30pm  ( the published check-in was 3pm )  ;  they said my room wasn't ready ;  where as others coming after me were assigned rooms . <s> Was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready . <s> I chilled there until 8pm ;  no call ;  so went out for dinner . <s> Came back at 9 : 30pm and asked if my room was ready . <s> The gal said of course yes and give me a key . <s> When asked why no one called me ;  she just shrugged . <s> No ;  my troubles did not end there . <s> I went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room . <s> Came back to the lobby ;  then they apologized and gave me another room . <s> I said I was not going to walk-in on somebody else again ;  so they sent someone with me to open the new room . <s> For all my  " trouble "  they reduced my bill by about 40 %  . <s> It was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru . <s> Very bad experience . <s> I've stayed at the Allegro a couple of times . <s> Like the other Kimpton properties ;  it's a classic old hotel that's been beautifully updated . <s> I found the staff to be cordial ;  and I really like their corporate culture . <s> They're pet-friendly  ( although I wasn't travelling with the dog )  ;  I got a recycling bin in my room ;  Aveda products in the bath and they don't clean with toxic chemicals . <s> The rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms aren't what you're going to get at a Hilton . <s> What the Allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool . <s> OK ;  they may be a little pricey ;  but I'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily . <s> This hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat . <s> The first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket . <s> This place looks alright in the lobby ;  but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in Chicago ;  this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night . <s> Clearly the Ambassador East Hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession . <s> Not to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic . <s> Chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached ;  particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call . <s> I just spent the weekend here with my wife ;  and she loved it as much as I do . <s> I was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients ;  so I didn't have any choice . <s> But when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago ;  I knew this was the place to take her . <s> The hotel hasn't just been remodeled ;  it's been completely redesigned . <s> Things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better ;  and the two rooms that I've seen are showplaces . <s> They are amazing . <s> This hotel is part of a luxury chain ;  and it's easy to see why . <s> They offer full room service at convenient hours . <s> I've been in every eating area now ;  and they are all great ;  too . <s> Whether for business or pleasure ;  you can't beat this . <s> It's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you'd expect . <s> My wife was stunned ;  and yours will be ;  too . <s> Swissotel Chicago - It's really a mess when I arrived at the hotel ;  there's only one receptionist dealing with 5 customers . <s> I have to wait for 15 minutes to begin my check in . <s> The room is clean and neat ;  but a little small for its high price . <s> The bathroom is uncleaned ;  which is really annoying . <s> I have to asked the room service to clean it after I arrived . <s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time . <s> Its proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor's delight . <s> It is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area ;  it is also close to the Loop ;  Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space . <s> Each guest room includes a flat screen HD TV . <s> The beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast . <s> The 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business . The hotel has a no-smoking policy . <s> It also has free internet facilities ;  room service ;  Air conditioning ;  laundry / drycleaning ;  multilingual staff to make communication easy ;  spa services ;  heating ;  conference facilities ;  satelite tv ;  brailed elevators and pets are allowed . <s> The Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great . <s> The hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty . <s> The staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand . <s> The hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean . <s> The hotel makes it possible for you to relax ;  go shopping in the best stores which are close-by ;  eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership . <s> They offer great deals for every type of customer . <s> I would definitely recommend this place . <s> The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago is by far the best experience I have ever had away from home . <s> From the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby ;  you will never want to leave . <s> The multiple ballrooms ;  board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events . <s> If you're looking for leisure activities ;  there are two bars ;  the Lockwood Wine Cellar ;  and an indoor pool . <s> The staff is professional ;  friendly and helpful . <s> Room service is excellent ;  and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city . <s> This hotel is the perfect location for downtown Chicago shopping . <s> The only thing is the pool is extremely small - it is indoors ;  but looks much larger on the website . <s> I recently was in Chicago on business and chose to stay at the Swissotel ;  Chicago . <s> The hotel sells itself as being stylish ;  sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city . <s> I would have been better off anywhere else . <s> I was not impressed with the interior ;  finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste . <s> I guess 'stylish' might be modern in some people's minds ;  but not mine . <s> Also ;  luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical . <s> When I made my way to reception ;  I hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website . <s> I had organized an executive suite as I was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room ;  and thought the extra space would come in handy . <s> When I proceeded to check in ;  the girl at the desk told me ;  while smacking gum ;  that I had no reservation . <s> I handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong ;  even though I had spelled it out for her . <s> She then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference ;  all of the executive suites had already been allocated ;  but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room . <s> Correct me if I am wrong ;  but this is a step down from the room I had asked for ! <s> Surely if you give away my room ;  you should try to compensate me with something better ! <s> I said that no ;  I really needed more space as I would be using the room as an office ;  and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available ;  and that if I wanted to switch the following evening ;  I would be welcome to do that . <s> The room was ok ;  although ;  again ;  I was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt . <s> I did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services ;  but found them sadly lacking . <s> Some comments on the services :  the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect ;  and also a per day fee which borders on extortion ! <s> There was free wifi in the lobby ;  but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air ;  plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out . <s> I did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels ;  but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived . <s> The fitness center and pool which I was looking forward to using ;  were closed for cleaning when I went up . <s> Breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items ;  which is not what I would have expected for the money . <s> All in all ;  I would say your money is better spent elsewhere . <s> I booked this hotel on Priceline for 4 / 13 ;  and a week later called the hotel directly to add 4 / 12 to our stay . <s> The receptionist confirmed my reservation confirmation #  and gave me a lower rate for both nights for the same king suite . <s> When we arrived at check-in ;  there was no record of my 4 / 12 reservation whatsoever . <s> The hotel was also fully booked ;  leaving my tired ;  hungry family and I high and dry with nowhere to go . <s> The only decent thing that happened with this whole debacle was that Lisa at the check-in desk called around to several other hotels close-by to find us a room ;  and seemed to be the only employee working at a very busy time of evening . <s> We ended up at Embassy Suites for both nights and had a very pleasant experience there . <s> My experiences at the Fairmont Chicago were less than desirable . <s> I try to be fair when I write my reviews ;  but fair is not in the Fairmont Chicago language . <s> From pulling up to check in I felt the gouging start . <s>  $ 54 a night for parking is terrible for this area  $ 30- $ 35 is the average and that is not affordable as it is but  $ 54 is just disgusting to put on your guests . <s> The parking was more than my car rental . <s> In the room the internet is not complementary it is  $ 16 for standard and  $ 25 for some sort of ultra upgraded internet service . <s> Gouge gouge gouge ;  who charges for internet anymore and even worse upgraded services . <s> I didn't go online every day of my 8 day stay because of the cost . <s> One update on the internet that they don't tell you upon check in is that if you sign up for the free premiere Fairmont club you will receive free in room internet service ;  I found that out on the last day of my stay . <s> Other issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good . <s> The bed was hard and uncomfortable . <s> And I would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city . <s> On a good note the Aria resturant in the Fairmont has a tremendous staff and serves up the best burger and fries I have ever had ;  loved the complimentary naan and dips to start ;  and the complimentary orange bark to finish . <s> During my latest business trip ;  both me and my wife recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel in Chicago ; Illinois ;  at one of their Deluxe suites . <s> Unfortunately ;  and I think I speak for both of us ;  we were not fully satisfied with the hotel . <s> The hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations ;  and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures ;  the service is certainly sub-par . <s> When one plans a stay at such an establishment ;  they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in . <s> First of all ;  the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on ;  the air coming out seemed musty . <s> Second of all ;  the fitness center was only open until 10 : 30 pm . <s> For people who like to exercise after dinner ;  this can certainly be a problem . <s> Especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight . <s> For these ;  as well as other similar reasons ;  I would not recommend this hotel ;  if one is looking for luxury accommodations . <s> As others have said ;  once all the construction works are completed I suspect that the prices this hotel can  ( legitimately )  charge will put it out of our price range . <s> Which will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel ;   &  the location couldn't be better . <s> The room was very spacious ;  with separate sitting  &  study areas  &  a nice bathroom . <s> Only 3 minor points :  downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast  ( coffee  &  pastries )  ;  but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this ;  the cost of internet -  $ 9 . 99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free ;  there was only powered milk in the rooms ;  which wasn't that nice . <s> But none of these really spolied a really enjoyable stay . <s> On a recent trip to Chicago to attend a major trade show I had the pleasure of staying with the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower . <s> I say stay with as that is how they make you feel ;  from check in to check out they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect and you want to return . <s> The rooms are clean ;  chic and roomy ;  the beds - the best I have slept in ;  bathrooms large and super clean . <s> What can I say ;  my new home when in Chicago ...  <s> My experience with the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was Terrible ! <s> I arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour . <s> I chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed I sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink I received was warm . <s> When the room was finally ready I was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding . <s> When I called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom . <s> After all this hassle I would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered I found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13 . 95 for a 24 hour period . <s> I was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels I have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access . <s> Overall I was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel any time soon . <s> Stay away from the Hyatt Regency Chicago . <s> I recently had to spend the weekend in Chicago on business ;  and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town ;  but alas ;  I was left disappointed . <s> I arrived in the afternoon ;  my flight having been delayed ;  ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening . <s> Unfortunately ;  my room was not ready . <s> It should have been ready hours earlier ;  but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff . <s> In any event ;  I was advised to wait in the bar ;  creatively named BIG Bar . <s> They seemed annoyed that I wanted only water ;  not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that I spent time in their hideously noisy establishment -- I wanted only to relax in my room . <s> I waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk . <s> Was my room ready yet ? <s> 'What room ? <s> ' they replied . <s> To my astonishment ;  it seemed that I no longer had a reservation ! <s> How this came to pass ;  I do not know ;  and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me . <s> I explained that I was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned ;  or furnished ;  or renovated ;  or whatever they were doing to make it ready ;  but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer ;  who spake  " Guest Not Found "  or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters . <s> I requested the manager ;  who was unavailable ;  presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either . <s> Finally ;  I admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel ;  with fewer regrets than I would have imagined ;  to find a better place to spend the night -- a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point . <s> As it was ;  I found another hotel ;  better priced ;  better staffed ;  and with rooms ready for my custom . <s> So if you are looking an experience like no other ;  book a room at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . <s> If you want a place to sleep ;  look elsewhere . <s> Our non-smoking room smelled very badly of stale cigarette smoke . <s> We were not allowed to change rooms . <s> Also ;  the concierge staff was unprofessional ;  telling long winded personal stories to uninterested guests while long lines formed . <s> The location was great . <s> Hotel is dated ;  but would still be a nice place to stay if it weren't for customer service issues . <s> James Chicago-The James is in a really convenient location ;  just a couple blocks east of the Red Line and right by Michigan Ave . <s> Despite having a room on the fourth floor by the elevators ;  the noise was pretty minimal . <s> The staff were really helpful and welcoming ;  giving it a very good atmosphere . <s> At a rate of  $ 255 ;  it was a very good value ;  I would stay here again . <s> I had reservations to check into the Chicago Conrad . <s> When we arrived my wife and I were told the hotel was oversold and that I would have to take a double room rather than a king . <s> This was a special weekend for my wife and I so this was a big disappointment . <s> We were offered a free dinner which we accepted . <s> The restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good . <s> The tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair . <s> This took about an hour to resolve . <s> Overall we would not pick this hotel again . <s> They should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition . <s> We feel it was not a good value . <s> Just returned from 2 nights at the Ambassador and I have to say that I am very happy that I chose this hotel . <s> It is true that this is an older hotel . <s> But it is well kept and it does not lack in style and grandeur . <s>  ( think of the hotel from the Shining ;  minus the elevator of blood and creepy twins . <s>  )  From the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids ;  I was made to feel like royalty . <s> A special acknowledgment goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions . <s> Also the location of the hotel is great . <s> Close to all the action ;  but on a quite residential street with beautiful old mansions . <s> I also got a sweet  $ 89 per night room by booking on travelzoo . <s> That was just an added bonus however . <s> Even if I paid  $ 200 per night ;  my impression of the Ambassador would not change . <s> Highly ;  highly recommended . <s> This is a great hotel ;  in a great location ;  in a great city  !  !  ! <s> There's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part . <s> The rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker ( s )  in the bathroom  ... <s> I had the Beatles and although they're not my cup of tea ;  I was happy enough with George staring back @ me ! <s> The hotel itself is on the corner of Michigan Ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants  ...  try the  " Cheesecake Factory "  or have a meal  /  cocktail on the top floor of the  " John Hancock Centre "  . <s> A slighty longer walk  ( or a short cab ride )  and you're at the  " Navy Pier "  - take a ride on the  " Seadog "  then enjoy all the fun of the fair  ...  or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music . <s> This hotel  (  &  city )  is WELL worth checking out . <s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that I have ever stayed at . <s> I stayed there for 3 days and two nights . <s> My room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully . <s> The staff was very kind and very helpful . <s> The concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in Chicago . <s> Overall ;  A beautiful hotel in a beautiful city . <s> ï»¿Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel ;  I had read some very good reviews of this hotel before I booked my stay ;  so perhaps my expectations were too high . <s> All-in-all I was quite disappointed and even a little â€˜creeped outâ€™ by the guy they sent up for my in-room massage . <s> The room seemed very small considering how much it cost and everything in it just seemed a little over-the-top  ( overly ornate woodwork ;  fussy furniture ;  and garish paintings made it seem like they were trying too hard ;  but not quite succeeding )  . <s> As for the masseur ;  there was nothing specifically wrong ;  but he just came across as kind of inappropriate . <s> They also claim to be in a great location in the heart of Chicago ;  but my room didnâ€™t have any of the wonderful views of the skyline they show on their website  ( however ;  it did have lots of traffic noise )  . <s> I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be going back anytime soon . <s> We stayed at the swissotel for our 25th anniversary . <s> We got a corner room with both a lake and city view . <s> The room was very clean and spacious . <s> The staff was extremely friendly and helpful . <s> We asked for late checkout ;  and was told no problem . <s> If you bring your car ;  park in millinum parking it is just 2 blocks away . <s> The cost there is  $ 14 . 00 compared to the swissotel which is  $ 41 . 00 . <s> The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges . <s> No - not a bit worn - very much so I'm sorry to say . <s> Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave .  can't be beat ;  and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons ;  there were quite a few bumps in the road . <s> Number one ;  the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing . <s> The desk chair was so badly worn that the  " lift "  button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we're not grossly obese . <s> The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable . <s> My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth ;  one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk . <s> The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink ;  so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door . <s> The towels were very well worn and thin ;  although bath sized ;  which was a plus . <s> The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say ;  it was horrific . <s> We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables ;  and they  ( appetizers )  were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen . <s> A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side ;  served on a large white plate ;  and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad . <s> Even the menu ;  as limited as it was ;  looked as though someone's child had written it out . <s> The good news is that Chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go . <s> Unfortunately for us ;  the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid  $ 325 / nt for our disappointments . <s> The good news is that the mini bars' wares were incredibly well-priced - when's the last time you had a  $ 4 beer anywhere in a hotel ? <s>  ( even if it was Bud and Bud lite - lol ! ~ )  The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating . <s> The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful ;  and the bed comfortable . <s> The A / C was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever ;  and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90's our entire stay . <s> Free wi-fi - YES ! <s> And it wasn't horribly grindingly slow ! <s> No need for the advertised  " upgrade "  for faster wi-fi . <s> Talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game . <s> Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased ;  but we were sadly not . <s> We always stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel  &  Towers when we take our kids to the city . <s> You can't beat the location which is in walking distance of Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . <s> The hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous Fox  &  Obel ;  a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast . <s> The hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds . <s> My kids enjoy the pool with it's windows that overlook the Chicago river . <s> Hotel is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud ;  it is hard to sleep during the night because all the  " city " noises coming from the outside . <s> The rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures . <s> I stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband ;  and we supposed to get room with king size bad ;  but instead we got ;  two single beds . <s> The stuff isn't really very nice either ;  they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you . <s> I gave the Conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably . <s> The hotel will not honor room requests . <s> I expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation . <s> I got there and my 'view' was of the adjacent office building windows . <s> I didn't pay nearly  $ 400 a night for that . <s> I called down and the manager was absolutely rude . <s>  " That would've required you to pay at least  $ 40 more ..  "  Rude . <s> Lots and lots of mistakes happened . <s> Requested pillows were never sent up ;  the television sound was not functioning  ( i . e . <s> NO sound )  ;  when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little . <s> I've had better service at a Hampon Inn ! <s> When they screwed up our breakfast vouchers I had to physically go down and question it ..  they said  " we will send them right up "  ..  No ;  that never happened . <s> Absolutely ridiculous . <s> The bathroom has always been nice ;  and the room had been renovated since I was there last year  ( thank the lord !  )  ... <s> It had a nice ambiance to it . <s> The bed was quite nice as well . <s> The valet guys were fantastic ;  probably the nicest men within that entire hotel . <s> Also the bellman ;  and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said  " hi "  or  " hope you have a wonderful day "  .. <s> I appreciated that . <s> Perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service . <s> Breakfast at the Conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely . <s> The service was abysmally inept ;  and not to mention slow . <s> We had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice . <s> They looked like they hated their jobs ;  and treated us with the same attitude . <s> We were never checked on after the food came . <s> The food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking . <s> I got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin  ( burnt )  ;  a small croissant ;  and a tiny cinnamon roll . <s> 14 dollars for that . <s> Laughable . <s> Or if you choose ;  for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice ! <s> Spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money . <s> Overall ;  the managers need to learn what customer service means ;  and how to bend over backwards for a customer . <s> Otherwise your business will crumble . <s> And the Conrad has crumbled for me . <s> I spent way too much money on terrible service . <s> I've already sent my opinions to Hilton headquarters . <s> I'll be looking at other hotels the next time im in Chicago . <s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park - Stayed for 2 days for business . <s> Great service ;  great room . <s> The wine bar in the lobby is a coffee bar in the morning ;  which saved me from running around to find a Starbucks nearby . <s> I found my room to be very large ;  but I may just be used to tiny NYC hotel rooms . <s> In addition to the standard desk ;  bed ;  bed stand and chair ;  there was a table in the center of the room and a couch underneath the window ;  and despite all of that furniture there was plenty of floor space . <s> My only gripe was that there wasn't much of a view - from the 16th floor ;  if you sat on the couch by the window and looked out the corner you could see the lake ;  but otherwise all I could see was the face of the building on the opposing street . <s> I've never written a review before ;  but I just had to share my experience with Chicago's InterContinental Hotel . <s> I booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife's birthday . <s> We've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and I thought this would be a great experience for us . <s> The horrors started when we first got to the counter . <s> The clerk mixed up our rooms and when I pointed this out he got really snooty with me . <s> We get to our room and the maid hadn't cleaned it yet ! <s> We had to wait around for that ;  so we went to the hotel's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced . <s> Finally our room is finished and the the  " view "  we were promised was non-existent . <s> To top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning . <s> The toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain . <s> A stain ! <s> on the sheets . <s> What a waste of money . <s> I pointed this out the concierge and we weren't even offered a refund or discount . <s> Never again . <s> The Conrad has all the right stuff - great bedding ;  fancy decorations ;  beautiful lobby ;  etc . <s> However ;  they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail . <s> When I checked in ;  I went to get a glass of wine from the minibar ;  only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm . <s> I called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it . <s> In the meantime ;  I said ;  great ;  but what about a cold drink ? <s> They proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service ;  without asking me if this would be okay . <s> I paid  $ 25 for 1 glass of wine . <s> The minibar bottle would've given me 2 glasses for about  $ 33 . <s> Nothing was said to me about this obvious difference . <s> When I called to complain ;  I was made to feel cheap . <s> To me ;  it was not the money ;  it was the principle . <s> The next morning ;  my bill showed that I had eaten something out of the minibar . <s> I had not . <s> I called ;  and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something  ( duh - when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it )  ;  and they took the charge off . <s> They also took  $ 10 off my room service bill ;  but I was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that I was overcharged . <s> Also ;  when they fixed the minibar fridge ;  they did not replace anything in it . <s> The guy said ;  it'll take a while for things to cool down . <s> Oh ;  really ? <s> How about the warm beer ;  that was once cold ;  that will now taste disgusting ? <s> I guess they're saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea . <s> Another annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work . <s> When I plugged it in ;  it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off ;  and then it never would come on . <s> It seems that the Conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful ;  without worrying about each customer's experience . <s> I don't think they go into the rooms and check them out . <s> And their sta <s> Booked a room online and got a great rate under  $ 200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in Chicago in this nice location ;  3 blocks I think from the water . <s> Even though our rate was so cheap ;  the service was wonderful ;  the front desk were polite &  cheerful ;  the doormen and valet were great and helpful ;  and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on ;  free of charge ! <s> The fitness room was clean ;  large and provided fruit and clean towels ;  and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel . <s> Location of hotel is safe ;  and such a beautiful area . <s> Check the rates directly online of the hotel's website ;  as it was the least expensive . <s> We will stay here again for sure . <s> We went to Chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at Homewood . <s> My first impression was great ;  very helpful valet employees and VERY nice . <s> That is one perk of my stay here . <s> Otherwise ;  we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has 19 floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the highest room avalible due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up ;  the more beautiful the view is . <s> So we got the 9th floor . <s> Not what I call  " high up "  when the rooms started on floor 6 . <s> Then the following morning ;  we went to breakfast of which was ok ;  nothing great . <s> My husband and I went down in jeans and a sweatshirt but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few bagles ;  some fruit ;  and that was it . <s> So ;  we got our food and sat down . <s> After getting stared at for the first 15-20 minutes ;  an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on . <s> Remind you ;  it was about 15-20 minutes after we had even entered the room . <s> So she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast . <s> Pretty pointless AFTER we already had gotten our food . <s> I am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long . <s> Last but not least ;  dont come with a clean car . <s> I had washed my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned ;  it was filthy dirty . <s> I had the misfortune of being booked at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago a few weeks ago . <s> What a joke . <s> To start off ;  the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed . <s> I don't know who made the bed up in my room ;  but it could have been done better by my 7 year old . <s> Ditto the bathroom . <s> Water spots ;  soap scum and  ( ugh )  hair of ALL kinds in the sink ;  tub and about the floor . <s> GROSS . <s> I requested non-smoking ;  either they didn't listen or didn't care ;  but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray . <s> The  " beautiful view "  was ruined by water spots - not outside ( which is forgiveable )  but INSIDE ! <s> And they were sticky . <s> I stayed only one night . <s> The Holiday Inn had rooms available ;  and they were clean . <s> Never Again . <s> My daughter's broken heart My daughter loves American Girl and for her birthday wanted to go to American Girl Doll in Chicago . <s> For six months my eight year old counted day the day until we left for Chicago when she could have the experience of a lifetime . <s> We arrived at the Talbot Hotel where we had reserved the American Doll Girl package only to find out that they had given our room away and that they were going to move us across town . <s> If that wasn't bad enough we had to spend an hour to find out if the American Girl carriage ride had been canceled or if we should book another one . <s> My daughter sulked for most of the trip as we spent more time going from thing to thing instead of being able to walk . <s> My daughter cried herself to sleep the first night and I could tell that her heart was broken . <s> The Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is great alternative to ordinary hotels . <s> The hotel is decorated with a huge variety of music memorabilia that makes the stay worth it alone . <s> The hotel is often visited by many talented artists including singers ;  dancers ; actors etc . <s> The staff were very polite and helpful and always pleasant . <s> The rooms were very clean and nicely decorated ;  as were the common areas and hallways . <s> I would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area . <s> We just returned from our first trip to Chicago and stayed at the Omni . <s> I read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the Omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on . <s> The location ;  staff ;  rooms ;  amenities ;  etc were all wonderful . <s> Huge thank you to TA members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program . <s> We did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks . <s> I loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the Chicago Tribune newspaper . <s> We were in room 816 which was perfect . <s> Corner suite with two out of the 3 sides of the rooms being windows with a great view . <s> The room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma TV . <s> The bathroom amenities were wonderful . <s> I loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided . <s> The turn down service was great as well . <s> We would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us . <s> We ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious . <s> The blueberry muffins were the best I have ever had . <s> Everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly . <s> The staff at the Omni is so accomodating . <s> Everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is . <s> Have to thank the concierge Melissa and Curtis . <s> They were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do . <s> I also used the gym during my stay and it was great . <s> All the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd TV attached . <s> And the gym itself had two plasmas . <s> They also had cold lemon water for you after your workout . <s> I am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning . <s> It really was a fantastic stay at the Omni and we would never stay anywhere else . <s> I also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there . <s> Everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed . <s> Thank you Trip Advisor for another great trip suggestion ! <s> Me ;  My sister and my best friend all went to stay here in the summer of 2004 ... they said there all spacious suites ... yeah right ... our room you could barely walk in ... and they said theres 2 double beds ... yeah well one was a pull out couch ... and the bathroom ... tiny tiny tiny ... and it took forever and a day to check in and the people blamed us for throwing a book out the window and somehow someone knew exactly where it fell from and which room ... yeah ... i wouldnt stay here again <s> Beautiful hotel ;  but doesn't have a lot to offer for the price . <s> Sheets and pillowcases in the room had stains on them ;  TV remote would not function properly . <s> Valet service truly needs improvement . <s> We payed quite a bit for overnight parking ;  and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave . <s> When we asked to find out what was taking so long ;  we got tossed back and forth between bell hop and front desk ;  with no answers . <s> The historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel . <s> Unfortunately ;  the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings . <s> The front desk staff was rude ;  the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door . <s> There are three elevators but good luck with them all working . <s> They are very very small and when only one is up and running ... you end up waiting a long time for one . <s> Not fun when you are on the 12th floor . <s> The room was TINY and the air conditioning did not work at all ... the room felt damp and miserable . <s> We put the thermostat as low as it would let us  ( 65 )  and the room never went below 78 . <s>  ( and it was 107 outside the whole trip !  !  !  )  . <s> There really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant . <s> Internet is not free either ... <s> Overall ;  I would never stay here again . <s> I was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago . <s> From the outside it looks like a great hotel ;  and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy ;  not what I expected when looked at the website . <s> The front desk staff was nice enough at first ;  but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra . <s> I mean come on ;  I'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA ? <s> The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation . <s>  ( Note to self ;  don't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd . <s>  )  So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow . <s> I guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview  ( from some of the rooms )  and it seems pretty safe . <s> Other than that I was not impressed for the price - I've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens ;  a better restaurant ;  where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour  ( we stayed two nights and we didn't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5 )  . <s> I guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell . <s> In general it seems lke it's on the decline and the staff knows it ;  they're just kind of lackadaisical . <s> I wouldn't stay there again . <s> We stayed here for a weekend trip to Chicago and we will come back and stay here again . <s> It was great place front desk clerks were very helpful . Also we loved the view . <s> Very nice quiet place and upto date and super clean . <s> We will def stay here again highly recommended . <s> Quite simply the Hyatt Regency Chicago is the business traveler's best friend . <s> Recently I had to attend a seminar in Chicago and stayed at the Hyatt . <s> To say I was impressed would be an understatement . <s> Centrally located in the heart of downtown ;  the Hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction . <s> On arrival the staff goes into overdrive . <s> They make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel . <s> The rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens . <s> My room came equipped with flat screen tv ;  wi-fi and high speed internet . <s> Room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you . <s> There were also car rental on site as were restaurants ;  cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room . <s> They have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features . <s> There is also catering and limo service . <s> The staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional . <s> All in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between . <s> This hotel is definitely worth the price and I will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered . <s> My only regret ? <s> That I could not stay much longer . <s> The Hilton Chicago is one of the best Hotels I have ever had the good fortune to lodge at in my entire life . <s> It is an extremely luxirious hotel located on the  " Cultural Michigan Avenue Mile "  ;  and it overlooks Grant Park ;  Lake Michigan ;  and Museum Campus . <s> In addition to overlooking those wonderful sights ;  it's also located conveniently close to Chicago's convention center ;  McCormick Place Convention Center ;  as well as the business center ;  shopping and theatre . <s> Furthermore ;  there are a myriad of attractions close to the hotel ;  such as Millenium Park ;  Buckingham Park ;  and the Sears Tower . <s> The amenities offered by the Hilton Chicago hotel include 100 %  wireless Internet access in all guest rooms ;  27 "  inch flat screen televisions ;  a Serenity Bed ;  and two-line direct dial phones . <s> And on top of all that ;  the hotel is pet friendly ! <s> I'll definitely be staying here again . <s> The Palmer House - I stayed at the Palmer House while traveling to Chicago to meet some old friends . <s> Unfortunately I arrived to Chicago O'Hare at 1 a . m .  after being delayed twice due to weather ;  but rather than having to take a cab ;  a shuttle bus was immediately available to take me to the hotel . <s> Upon arrival I had another difficulty surrounding the double booking of my room . <s> Even at 2 a . m .  Rachel at the front desk was able to help me with a smile as she upgraded my room for free . <s> Once these two problems had been dealt with the rest of my stay in Chicago was delightful . <s> Beware that some of the images on the website make the rooms appear much larger than they really are ;  but my room was very comfortable regardless . <s> The Palmer House served my needs perfectly ;  and I anticipate staying there again next year when I come back . <s> I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business . <s> It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable . <s> The rooms are spacious ;  great beds ;  pillows and linen . <s> The bathroom has a great shower and bath . <s> WiFi works really well and the desk is large . <s> The staff are wonderful . <s> The location is great for shopping ;  spa's ;  Starbucks and hairdressers . <s> I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it . <s> Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel . <s> Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour ;  and the accomodations were quite nice  ( our beds were very soft and comfortable )  . <s> We had excellent views of the river from our rooms . <s> The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town ;  with easy access to public transportation nearby . <s> My friends actually received the goldfish upon request ;  which they enjoyed . <s> Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above ;  but it was minimal . <s> Price seemed very resonable to us for the location . <s> Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again . <s> This hotel was full of drunks . <s> The lobby was full of crowds at night and the bar was way too busy . <s> There were people stumbling all over the hotel at all hours of the night ;  yelling in the hallways ;  making lots of noise . <s> The staff had little to say . <s> I wasn't aware of the noise level when I booked the room and when I threatened to make other reservations ;  the people in the lobby had nothing to say . <s> We asked for a water view and got a city view . <s> Again ;  the people at the front desk weren't accomodating at all . <s> Overall ;  we had a horrible experience . <s> We loved the hotel . <s> When I see other posts about it being shabby I can't for the life of me figure out what they are talking about . <s> Rooms were large with TWO bathrooms ;  lobby was fabulous ;  pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym ;  staff was courteous . <s> For us ;  the location was great -- across the street from Grant Park with a great view of Buckingham Fountain and close to all the museums and theatres . <s> I'm sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the Magnificent Mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location . <s> Got it for  $ 105 on Hotwire . <s> What a bargain for such a nice hotel . <s> My visit to the Conrad Chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none . <s> The lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style . <s> The rooms are beautifully adorned . <s> I especially like the flat screen TV and wired internet . <s> I'm never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast ;  reliable internet connectivity ;  and it's included at no additional charge . <s> The view from the room was magnificent ... downtown Chicago at night ! <s> The Restaurant is spectacular but the Terrace is the place to be when weather permits . <s> You cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods . <s> Don't forget to visit the Health and Fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment . <s> The staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need . <s> Just ask ! <s> This is the place to stay in Chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury ! <s> Our first visit to Chicago and I really cannot wait to go back . <s> The hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful . <s> Particular mention should go to the door staff who were amazingly helpful . <s> The room was clean ;  quiet and spacious ;  if only every hotel were like this . <s> This hotel was gorgeous ! <s> I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future . <s> The staff was friendly ;  the room was clean ;  comfortable and very well decorated . <s> The restaurant /  room service was also exceptional . <s> The food was delicious and the room service was prompt . <s> This hotel is also in a great location . <s> It is close to everything anyone may need ;  such as shopping ;  food and attractions . <s> I was extremely disappointed with my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . <s> It was a hot summer day and I turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out . <s> I called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it . <s> I felt the person I spoke to was rude to me . <s> They were not accepting responsibility ;  but talking down to me as if I was stupid . <s> After waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower . <s> This was not a service person . <s> He could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem I was having . <s> He expected a tip and complained when I did not give him one . <s> Nobody came up after that . <s> I was told I could switch to a different room ;  so I had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor . <s> The shower did work in this other room ;  but I didn't have the view of the city that I had in the first room . <s> I was looking at a brick wall . <s> Plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night . <s> I complained and the hotel staff told me they were VIPs and could not do anything about the noise . <s> This hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable . <s> Do not go to the Omni Hotel . <s> I've stayed in  $ 50 a night motels with better service . <s> Fairmont - Our stay at the Fairmont Hotel was wonderful . <s> The hotel is conveniently located close to the park and downtown Chicago . <s> We got a great room on the 8th floor and it was clean ;  well-maintained and spacious . <s> The best part of our stay were the very comfortable King size beds . <s> They had a great sushi bar and a first-rate gym that was large and well equipped . <s> On the 2nd day of our stay ;  they even provided us with complimentary massages at the spa . <s> I had such high hopes when I booked a stay at the Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago a few short weeks ago . <s> When I arrived I should have known things would not be as I expected them to be . <s> The host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that I was there . <s> When I finally got checked in and arrived in my room I found that the temperature in the room was far too hot . <s> The air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot ;  muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room . <s> I turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down . <s> Since I arrived in the early afternoon I decided to order room service from the Nix Restaurant that is in the hotel ;  I ordered the Gooey Triple Decker Grilled Cheese ;  at  $ 14 I was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich I had ever eaten . <s> When it finally arrived ;  more than an hour later ;  it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey ! <s> It also comes with a bowl of Tomato Bisque soup which ;  needless to say was also cold . <s> For the quality of the food ;   $ 14 was way too much to pay for this meal . <s> After a meeting with clients we stopped by the Martini Bar for drinks . <s> The waitress was rude and seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to serve . <s> Needless to say it took forever to get our drinks . <s> We heard other patrons grumbling about the amount of time it took for the drinks to arrive as well . <s> Finally we got our drinks ;  we all ordered a French Martini . <s> We all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered ;  it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very ;  very tart . <s> At  $ 14 each you would think it would be made to perfection ;  far from it . <s> The evening finally over I went back to my room where I now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have . <s> After a miserable night I checked out glad to be done with the Knickerbocker Hotel ! <s> The best service !  !  ! <s> The staff here was incredible . <s> You never had to lift a finger . <s> The room was huge as hotel rooms go . <s> The view was phenomenal . <s> Location great . <s> What a great weekend . <s> We did stop for a drink at the Palm Restaurant and unfortunately ;  it closes at 11 p . m .  Too bad !  !  ! <s> The Lobby Lounge is open later but drinks costs twice as much as the bar at the Palm . <s> intercontinentalchicago - This hotel was spectacularly revolting . <s> From the ghastly lobby decorating ;  to the loathsome hotel staff ;  I had a harrowing experience the entire time . <s> Do yourself a favor and be sure to not try the self declared wonderful hotel food . <s> Especially the belgian waffles ;  otherwise you might have to spend the night like I did on the admittedly large bathroom floor . <s> One good thing about the hotel is the location ;  the front entrance puts you right on the magnificent mile ;  and close to all of the museums and the aquarium and whatever else you might want to see while you're in town . <s> However you can save yourself some money and agony by staying at another much nicer hotel for a far more reasonable price and still see the same attractions . <s> I booked my room at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers somewhat reluctantly ;  I was not enthusiastic about spending over  $ 200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website . <s> I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online . <s> Unfortunately ;  my hopes were dashed once again when I arrived at my room . <s> I say 'at' because after discovering my newly issued key was not working ;  I had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in . <s> The room was painfully small --  if I didn't know better I would have thought I was staying at a Red Roof Inn ! <s> The  " sweet sleeper bed "  had stiff and scratchy sheets ;  with a cheap-motel-thin coverlet . <s> The disappointment continued after I entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke ;  but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible . <s> I stayed my two nights ;  and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room  ( for which I was not responsible )  ;  charged on demand movies ;  an empty mini bar ;  AND for smoking in the bathroom . <s> HAH ! <s> I have stopped payment on my credit card ;  and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again . <s> My experience at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was not very pleasant . <s> When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by our  " Experience Designer "  who was not the friendliest of people . <s> Also ;  me and my husband tossed and turned all night on their very uncomfortable bed . <s> For the price ;  I would have expected a more luxurious experience . <s> We just got back from a trip to Chicago for my 30th birthday and we could not have been more impressed by this hotel ! <s> Service was excellent ;  especially the maid service . <s> Our room was so clean and fresh towels brought in daily . <s> The front desk staff was some of the most professional and friendly staff I have ever dealt with while travling . <s> The location is excellent as it is within walking distance of the best restaurants and stores . <s> I highly recommend Affinia for a the perfect family vacation . <s> Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown - Excellent hotel . <s> It is a little expensive but worth the money . <s> My parents and I share a two-double-bed room and the beds are big and soft . <s> Most important ;  the room is clean and smells good . <s> The breakfast buffet is great and has all kinds of fresh fruits  ( this is my favorite part )  . <s> The hotel is near a metro station so it is convenient for people like us who don't have a car . <s> We stayed at the AE for two nights for a three generation  " girls weekend "   ( Grandma ;  mom and daughter )  . <s> I looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us . <s> Then I called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named Reece . <s> Rates were a bit high for the Saturday night portion of our stay but when I requested the American Girl Package ;  he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate . <s> The American Girl package was perfect for us . <s> My 8 year old daughter was thrilled . <s> They give you a doll bed ;  a backpack and a travel kit to keep . <s> They have matching bathrobes for girl and doll  ( you don't get to keep those )  . <s> She also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu . <s> Our room ;  1334 ;  was large and clean . <s> It had two double beds with nice linens ;  two chairs ;  a desk and a clean bathroom . <s> The employees are all very friendly and helpful . <s> We had a drink in the Pump Room but did not eat there . <s> We ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd Coast . <s> This hotel is north of Michigan Ave . <s> But it is just a short ;  pleasant walk to the Mag . <s> Mile . <s> I would definately stay here again in Chicago . <s> I arrived and my friends were already there and visiting a nearby art gallery . <s> They put my name on the reservation and told me to get a key from the front desk when I arrived . <s> The front desk staff gave me the key to my room and I put my stuff away and went to meet the group . <s> We returned late that night and I soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that I placed my stuff in that afternoon . <s> We went to speak with the front desk . <s> We were met with  " We can't do anything about that right now due to the hour . <s> We will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in . <s>  "  Unacceptable !  !  ! <s> My  $ 1500 laptop and all of the things I brought with me were in that room ! <s> Not my mistake ! <s> FINALLY ;  after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes ;  they knocked on the door of the room I had left my belongings in and a lady answered . <s> She was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon . <s> All of my belongings were recovered in the security room ;  however ;  all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation ! <s> Terrible ;  terrible customer service . <s> They sent up an apology letter ;  champagne ;  and chocolate covered strawberries to the room . <s> Although I was appreciative of the gesture ;  it still does not excuse the fact that they argued and continued to say  " We can't do anything about it . <s>  "  <s> This might be a classy looking hotel in downtown Chicago ;  and while the location is not bad ;  the rooms are definitely hit or miss . <s> They range from the super basic  " affordable "  room to the presidential and huge suites that only presidents could probably even afford . <s> With so many different room options ;  it's no wonder they have difficulty honoring your exact reservation if you check-in past 4 : 00 pm . <s> The hotel has a decent pool ;  but the health club is extra per day ;  as are many other services at the hotel . <s> You'd imagine that for the price of a stay here  (  $ 160 up to multiple hundreds )  that more things would be included ! <s> Additionally ;  the check-in staff was a bit snobby and unhelpful . <s> I really would expect great service for the high price of a stay here . <s> If I were to return to Chicago again ;  I'd definitely try out staying somewhere else . <s> My in-laws booked a one night stay for New Years Eve for the two of us to stay at the James . <s> To be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will prevent us from returning and advising our friends not to stay there . <s> 1 )  Shoddy construction of room fixtures :  ceiling light was missing leaving a fist-sized hole with wires exposed ;  BOTH towel racks fell off the wall without being touched ;  and bathroom door often came off it's sliding mechanism with gentle use . <s> 2 )  When we reported these problems ;  employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall . <s> 3 )  Upon check-out ;  they did not have record of my in-laws paying for our stay ;  though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us . <s> We had to pay for our  (  $ 300 )  gift and the in-laws were extremely upset . <s> When we wrote a letter to management  ( as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left )  we did not receive an adequate apology . <s> Good location and looks like a good property but did not seem to be managed well . <s> Front desk staff was inattentive to customers and slow . <s> Nice large suite for a room but plumbing fixtures were in disrepair  ( housekeeping staff could / should have reported each day )  - partially clogged shower head ;  dripping sink ;  etc . <s> Clean and OK ;  but neglected - we expected more from an Intercontinental Hotel . <s> Many hotels to choose from in this area of Chicago - can get more for the price from almost any other . <s> This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago . <s> It is ideal for the corporate executive . <s> Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean . <s> The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience . <s> While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city ;  which is picturesque especially at night ;  when the city lights come on . <s> The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area . <s> I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive ! <s> has gone downhill so much we almost checked out . <s> We stayed in the Dean Martin Celebrity Suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in Chicago . <s> We've stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the Four Seasons or the Peninsula ;  it has always been a comfortable and clean ;  service oriented hotel . <s> Not only has room service been eliminated  ( if you want room service it comes from Marios Italian restaurant down the street ;  so is ONLY Italian )  ;  complimentary morning coffee is no longer available ;  mini bars have been removed from the rooms ;  etc . <s> etc . <s> The only restaurant ;  the Pump Room was closed for a private function on Saturday night ;  the bar also ;  so we weren't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests . <s> Surely the function was planned before we made our reservations ;  but we weren't told of it . <s> We also learned that the bell staff  ( who have been there for 13 and 8 years )  is being eliminated . <s> So ;  in other words ;  anyting to do with  " service "  is gone from this hotel . <s> I hear they are going to begin renovations in December ;  but that is no excuse to let an old glory  " go to pot "  in the meantime . <s> We won't be staying here when we go back in July or for Thanksgiving . <s> We even had to pay for internet . <s> Mind you ;  our bill for 3 nights was 900 . 00+ ;  no room service ;  no restaurant / bar charges . <s> Highway robbery for what you get ow at the Ambassador East . <s> Sad . <s> Conrad Chicago - The Conrad Chicago is not just another 5-star hotel . <s> My room was everything you can expect from an executive suite . <s> Luxurious bathroom ;  nice TV with plenty of choice for the channels ;  comfortable desk and speedy wifi connection were all appreciable . <s> The beds were very comfortable and I was glad to get a good night of sleep after a day full of meetings . <s> The location is also very convenient ;  as it litteraly downtown ;  close to where everything happens . <s> Nothing to say about the staff which was very nice ;  although it took a bit more time than i'm used to for the room service to bring my breakfast on the morning I left . <s> My husband and I wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago to celebrate our anniversary ;  and I had been looking at the James for awhile because it was attached to David Burke's Primehouse . <s> From the moment I called to make my reservation ;  I knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that . <s> From the pre-arrival dossier ;  to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the James ;  this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service . <s> The rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend . <s> The walking distance to Michigan Av is a huge plus . <s> From the front desk to the cleaning staff ;  the staff here is top notch ! <s> And David Burke's Primehouse is not to be missed ! <s> We stayed at the Swissotel for a three day weekend ;  and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived . <s> Is it just me ;  or is this information not clearly stated on their website ? <s> A giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming . <s> The room itself was fine . <s> More bland and generic than the  " European elegance "  claimed on their website . <s> The lack of hot water ;  was definitely not fine though . <s> There were a couple pluses to our stay at Swissotel . <s> The location is good ;  the bed was comfortable and the room was clean . <s> These few good points certainly did not redeem our experience ;  and I wouldn't pick this place again ;  even post-construction . <s> My family has dubbed the Omni in Chicago  " Fawlty Towers "  because there always seems to be something wrong . <s> This time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long . <s> It smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing . <s> The bedroom window was bolted shut ;  so we couldn't get any fresh air into the room . <s> With the amount that the Omni is charging for a room ;  they should have a much better ventilation system . <s> The Ambassador East was a average hotel at best ;  and mediocre at worst . <s> The bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff . <s> The doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you . <s> The room was lackluster ;  however . <s> The bathroom was in especially bad shape . <s> It was dirty when we arrived ;  with hair in the sink and shower . <s> The shower was in really bad shape . <s> The shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low . <s> The water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit . <s> The decor throughout the hotel  ( lobby ;  hallways and rooms )  was very out-of-date and old-fashioned . <s> I would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well . <s> The business center with free Internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use . <s> The hotel's location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations . <s> I would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions ;  but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms ;  I might be inclined to stay there again . <s>  ... read more <s> James Chicago ;  the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised . <s> I didn't want stay in this hotel ;  but my wife insisted . <s> Ok ;  so when I booked the ticket ;  it cost me  $ 299 for one room . <s>  $ 299 ! <s> I could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point ! <s> The room was stylish though ;  it looked nice . <s> There was a TV ;  and the beds were fine . <s> Although I couldn't quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer . <s> Why would I even need wifi if there is no computer ? <s> What were they thinking !  ? <s> The experience I had with James Chicago was a bit below of what I had expected . <s> I mean the food available there wasn't very tasty at all . <s> I had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet ;  but they had no computer ;  only wifi . <s> That's like only having bread ;  without any fillings to make it into a sandwich ! <s> I booked a room at the Hyatt through Priceline and was able to get a rate of  $ 45 / night ! <s> Can't go wrong with that ! <s> The rooms are nice ;  spacious ;  clean and contain all the amenties a traveler would need . <s> I have to say that I have fallen in love with the Hyatt chain due to their customer service . <s> I have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly ;  which you don't often see at other hotels . <s> I used the self-check in machine ;  and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly . <s> Then ;  when she saw that my room was not on a high level ;  she offered to have it changed for me so that I could have a better view . <s> I would highly recommend this hotel ! <s> I stayed at the Fairmont Chicago at Millenium Park while I was interviewing with a financial firm in the city . <s> I was amazed by the style and class of the place as soon as I walked into the lobby . <s> The room was pleasant and full of amenities ;  the bed was great and the bathroom quite spacious . <s> The hotel's location would be great for someone looking to enjoy the city ;  as it is directly next to key attractions . <s> Overall I was very pleased with my experience ;  though I would have liked to try more of what the hotel had to offer  ( like the restaurant and wine room )  . <s> First let me say ;  the front office people at Hotel Monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what I'd hoped . <s> There are some other problems ;  the furnishings are quite rundown ;  and housekeeping wasn't very helpful . <s> We booked a suite and the sofa bed ;  chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use . <s> I've attached pictures ;  so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows . <s> Comfortable it was not ! <s> The chair bottom is all broken down too . <s> I invited one of the Assistant Managers to view our furniture ;  and a slight adjustment was made in our rate . <s> As to housekeeping ;  we had ordered an in-room coffee service  ( which Kimpton's web site says is there ;  but you have to specifically request )  and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee . <s> We had to call the front desk every day . <s> And ;  housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl . <s> I had requested water be added to the bowl when I noticed it going down and my note was disregarded . <s> These things may not matter to you ;  but if you plan to spend a week ;  like we did ;  you might want to be comfortable . <s> The bedroom and bathroom were superior ;  just the living room was bad . <s> My wife and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and will most defiantly not go back . <s> The customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either . <s> When we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key . <s> When we got into the room the bed was not even properly made . <s> The cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food . <s> We ended up going home two days before we planned . <s> THE ROOM I booked a room here and was told I'd be getting a king bed . <s> When I check in ;  they say they only have a queen bed room available . <s> I protested to no avail . <s> When I got to the room ;  it was really only a full size bed . <s> So I went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in Chicago . <s> For the pleasure ;  I paid the same price as a normal king bed room . <s> The full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable . <s> I think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses . <s> We would wake up with body aches and headaches . <s> My wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights . <s> Not good . <s> Also ;  the internet in the room is hard to set-up ;  slow to use ;  and inconsistent . <s> I generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work . <s> The internet worked one day on my iPhone and then would not log me in . <s> It's not really worth it . <s> ROOM SERVICE Room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical . <s> Some mornings they would take our towels  ( even the ones we hung up to use again )  and not replace them ;  other times they would replace some towels and not others . <s> They would also come at vastly different times . <s> HOTEL SERVICE This hotel LOVES to nickel and dime . <s> I asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be  $ 25 . <s> No other hotel I've ever stayed in  ( regardless of how many stars it had )  has ever charged me for a fridge in the room . <s> Late checkout ? <s> charge . <s> Shuttle from the airport ? <s> - nonexistent . <s> The front deck  " gold passport "  people can't even figure out how to get you points . <s> In the end I will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay  ( not that i plan on staying at a Hyatt property again )  . <s> By the way ;  apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing . <s> I was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying  $ 25 . <s> THE HOTEL The hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower . <s> The west tower has some underground amenities no one uses . <s> The bars are extremely expensive ;  but the drinks are tasty . <s> The food is edible too ;  but I wouldn't brag about it . <s> The hotel is not directly on the main street  ( Michigan )  ;  but it's not too far from it . <s> It's right next to the boat tours and ;  in some rooms ;  has a view of the Navy Pier . <s> Our room faced another hotel ;  but we could see a sliver of the pier . <s> The hotel is walking distance from Millennium Park . <s> It's a bit of a walk to any of the L stations though . <s> If you want a wonderful breakfast place ;  go to Wildberry on Randolph st . <s> It'll have you waiting to eat for a long time ;  but it's yummy ! <s> CONCLUSION I get better rooms ;  better beds ;  better service ;  and better amenities at a Holiday Inn Express or a Best Western . <s> Save the money and stay elsewhere . <s> The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is absolutely magnificent . <s> The rooms are of utmost standard and you get treated with such respect . <s> The staff is always there no matter what . <s> Not only is the hotel beautiful but it surrounded by beautiful lights and beautiful skyscrapers . <s> I give it two dumbs up . <s> If you are ever in Chicago the InterContinental Chicago is the place to stay . <s> I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is tops . <s> The service at the hotel is first class . <s> The rooms are modern and very comfortable . <s> The location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants . <s> Highly recommend to both business travellers and couples . <s> This is a great hotel ! <s> From the doorman who greeted us as we arrived ;  to the young man at the reservation desk to the young woman serving complimentarily wine ;  everyone was very friendly and helpful . <s> We were  " strangers but for a minute ! <s>  "  The room was extremely clean ;  well appointed and we had a pretty view of the Chicago River ;  especially enjoyed from the large window seats . <s> Loved the purple polka-dot paper on the toilet paper roll ! <s> Hallways were large and quiet . <s> The restaurant next door ;  South Water Kitchen is very nice too . <s> The location is in walking distance of the theatres ;  parks ;  the river  ( take a cruise )  ;  Michigan Ave . <s> It's ideal . <s> The only negative is that the concierges were not nearly as friendly or inviting as the rest of the staff nor were they very helpful . <s> For a self-sufficient traveler ;  you wouldn't really need their services  ( although it is nice )  but for someone coming to Chicago for the first time ;  a concierge can be very helpful . <s> I would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it . <s> The Good LOCATION Views Decor Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad Shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The Ugly Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up . <s> I am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotel's iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up . <s> Also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower . <s> The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately . <s> Also ;  they mentioned that they had AREADY been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers . <s> My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency while attending a family wedding in Chicago . <s> From the moment we entered the beautiful lobby we were treated as if we were returning friends . <s> Our rooms were ready upon arrival ;  and they were just as impressive as when I viewed them online . <s> The location couldn't be more convenient to access all of Chicago's shopping and dining areas . <s> We dined in Seston's Chop House ;  which I highly recommend . <s> The staff at the hotel are professionals who work to make your stay there a grand experience . <s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the Windy City ! <s> I am not much of a complainer ;  as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site ;  but the Talbott provided such bad service that I feel the need to warn future travelers to Chicago :  My girlfriend and I stayed at the Talbott for 2 nights in late July 2006 . <s> The first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone . <s> The receptionist was outright rude ;  but took the reservation without a mistake . <s> During our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent ;  the waiters ;  the managers ;  nobody was friendly ;  nor tied to accommodate us . <s> [ --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  -- ] We and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hour's party . <s> The hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions . <s> When we returned from the reception at 11 : 50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends . <s>  " Nobody told us ;  we can't do anything for you . <s>  "   " Are you sure that you arranged this ? <s>  "  Two quotes so typical for this hotel's staff that I know that I will never stay at this hotel again . <s> I understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel ;  but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what I know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste . <s> [ --  -- -] <s> Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations . <s> I had no idea it would be so large ;  so nice and with so many amenities . <s> I also didn't realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute . <s> We were met at the door by the friendliest staff . <s> Even with a long line at check-in ;  the entire process was about 10 minutes . <s> We enjoyed the room with the up-to-date TV ;  decent size bathroom and comfortable bed . <s> Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant . <s> Paid  $ 200 / night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago . <s> We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale ;  but we also paid over  $ 300 / night there . <s> The Conrad Hilton recently took over this property from the failed Meridian Hotel . <s> It seems that the Conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesn't work . <s> The entrance is very difficult to find . <s> There are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby . <s> As a result ;  there was often a line waiting for them . <s> The same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area . <s> If you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay ;  you will find the poor elevator layout annoying . <s> The King room is what I would consider small compared to other Chicago hotels . <s> Although I like modern design ;  the room was quite stark and cold . <s> It was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear . <s> The bathroom was the best part . <s> Has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk ? <s> It was the most uncomfortable set-up I've experienced . <s> The views are non-existent for most of the rooms . <s> In a city with amazing vistas ;  this was disappointing . <s> I saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them . <s> Room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay . <s> Excellent food and high quality presentation . <s> Sorry I couldn't write a better review . <s> Would I stay here again ? <s> No . <s> Chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them . <s> I had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at The Talbott Hotel in Chicago . <s> I thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom ;  shopping and enjoying a bit of Chicago's exciting night life . <s> I found The Talbott Hotel's website and decided The American Girl Package they offer was what I was looking for . <s> The price sounded reasonable ;  so I booked a room . <s> The two of us were so very excited to spend some time together . <s> We arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5 : 00 on that Friday afternoon . <s> After making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour . <s> They blamed this on shortage of maids that day . <s> They did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend . <s> When we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room . <s> This disappointed my daughter ;  she was looking forward to that . <s> While they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined . <s> The rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly . <s> We managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website . <s> Would I go to the Talbott Hotel again ? <s> Probably not . <s> Got a great deal through Hotwire for  $ 70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again ;  even at full price . <s> We really liked the rooms muted modern decor ;  we had John Lennon and Bono for company . <s> Comfortable bed ;  mini coffe maker ;  plenty storage space and a lovely ;  clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products  ( so I was sold straight away ... it doesn't take much ;  I know !  )  . <s> If you're a product junkie ;  tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies  :  )  We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave ;  found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed  ( reception ;  gift shop and bar )  . <s> The bar area is very trendy ;  I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking ... the lack of memorabilia didn't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway . <s> The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh ;  and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a  " friendly lady looking for business "  when he was at the bar . <s> I think it's a place you will either love or hate ;  if you like laid back ;  contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you ! <s> I stayed at Swissotel Chicago when I was on business and it was very nice . <s> The staff was very helpful and room was very clean . <s> I would stay again in a heart beat ! <s> I just got back from theTalbott hotel in Chicago ! <s> I was very pleasantly surprised . <s> Anyway ;  the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situated . <s> The hotel is beautiful and luxurious . <s> It was busy and the line was a little long ;  but it moved quickly . <s> The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good ;  especially since it seemed to be near full . <s> The room was clean and spacious  ( especially considering it's a city hotel )  . <s> The lady gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! <s> My husband is not as easily impressed ;  but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon . <s> Overall ;  really nice stay ;  I will highly recommend to my friend this hotel . <s> Hotel Allegro - This hotel attempted to create a kind of retro ;  old-modern atmosphere . <s> For some people ;  this hotel would fit them stylistically . <s> Although the price was okay ;  I personally would have preferred staying at the Westin or some other hotel that is very modern and more accomodating to business travelers . <s> Staying in Chicago only for the weekend ;  I would rather have enjoyed a much larger room  ( the rooms were so tiny )  ;  and more modern amenities  ( the tiny bathroom was under-equipped )  . <s> Also ;  the walls are paper thin ;  I could hear pretty much everything going on in the rooms around me . <s> Having tea and wine for free at certain times was nice ;  but overall I would say that ;  for the price ;  I would definitely not recommend this Hotel . <s> I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip . <s> The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great . <s> I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny ;  but ours was perfectly fine ;  with funky ;  fun doors . <s> The decor is a lot of fun . <s> We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise . <s> The front desk staff was very friendly ;  and before we even made it to the desk ;  a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival . <s> We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier . <s> For people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away . <s> I definitely recommend this hotel ! <s> My husband and I recently stayed at your Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ;  and what a fantastic experience it was . <s> We stayed in one of the 'Extreme Suites' and let me tell you it was beautiful . <s> The furniture and paintings were amazing and the view was to die for . <s> The staff treated us really well and met all of our needs and then some . <s> I especially loved the spa . <s> We stayed for a week but I could have stayed a lot longer . <s> It was very comfortable and welcoming . <s> We will make sure to recommend your hotel to our friends and will be back the next time we are in Chicago . <s> Thanks so much ! <s> My husband and I planned a romantic getway for past several months and was looking forward to spending the end of the summer in Chicago . <s> However our excitement soon turned to disappointment and frustrations upon our arrival . <s> The hotel was quite charming when we walked in the door but then everything went wrong . <s> The gentleman checking us in could not find our reservation and was quite impatient and rude once we showed our confirmation papers . <s> The manager did make accomondations for us after much discussion back and forth . <s> We did not have towels in the room when we checked in and it took at least an hour and several phone calls before the towels were sent to our room . <s> Needless to say ;  I was extremely tired and wanted nothing more than to take a warm shower and turn in . <s> If we had not paid the total cost up front ;  we would have just left and check into another hotel . <s> no bell boys there when you need them ;  sully staff ;  no smiles at all in this place . <s> had to wait 30 min for my luggage and was never greeted by any of the staff . <s> boy ;  sure is a lousy fairmont compared to the one in SF . <s> never here again ! <s> Arrived at 1 : 30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel . <s> If you party and stay out all night anyway ;  this hotel would be fine . <s> But don't plan to get any rest if the club is open ! <s> Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in . <s> She was fine with me and gave me a corner room ;  but sure wouldn't want to be on her bad side . <s> I stayed at the Fairmont to attend a conference . <s> I was very pleased with the hotel . <s> The doorman offered me an umbrella as I headed out for a walk ...  and sure enough it started to rain very soon after- I would have been soaked with it . <s> Upon my return ;  the doorman then asked about my walk ;  etc . <s> This is reflective of all the staff I encountered . <s> The front desk promptly checked me in . <s> DEFINITELY register for their rewards program before you arrive ... <s> The complimentary gym access is excellent ;  plus you save on internet access fees which are waived for members . <s> The bathroom and separate dressing areas were large and convenient . <s> The only negative- no coffee maker ! <s> AND the Starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate offices are closed those days !  !  ! <s> Otherwise my stay was perfect ;  considering the conference rate was  $ 99 per night ! <s> My wife and I brought our daughter downtown for a blowout  " American Girl "  Weekend and chose the Monaco because of it's glowing reviews . <s> We arrived late and maybe that's when they put out their second-stringers ;  but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff -- like we were an intrusion . <s> I'll never understand this -- they're in the hospitality business and they're inhospitable ! <s>  ( This is getting picky ;  but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage Louis Vuitton trunk needs some maintenance . <s> The repeated  " HM "  initials are peeling off -- looks like they used rub-downs where they should have silk screened for durability )  . <s> When we got to our room we found the maid's ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed  ( yuck !  )  . <s> I'm still trying to figure out that scenario . <s> There were no ashes -- so I've ruled out spontaneous combustion . <s> Also ;  to the disappointment of my daughter ;  the much-advertised goldfish was MIA . <s> The bellhop  ( who apologized for the shoes )  explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed  "  ... is that OK ? <s>  "  he said . <s> I think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35C /  fish to make a tired 5-year-old happy . <s> On the up side ;  the rooms are nice and have an over-the-top decoration that my daughter loved  (  " I'd like to live here ! <s>  "  she said )  . <s> The bed is VERY comfortable -- my wife wants the same brand now . <s> The bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower -- except for the cheap fall-apart-while-you're-using-it toilet paper . <s> Come on Kimpton ! <s> How much can a decent roll cost ? <s> The view towards the river is great  ( try to get one )  and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window -- she closed the curtains and was in her own  " club house "  watching the world go by from from high above the city . <s> In short :  very nice hotel -- desk staff at night could be nicer  ( wouldn't cost anything and would have made up for the maid's shoes ! <s>  )  <s> The Talbott Hotel is fantastic ! <s> I stayed there on business and found that it met my every need . <s> The high speed internet access worked flawlessly ;  allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room . <s> I really like to exercise before a day of meetings ;  access to the fitness club next door was very convenient . <s> Last point :  I work for a green consulting firm out of L . A .  and the hotel's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission . <s> Guilt free luxury ! <s> After staying for a week in Chicago ;  my thoughts :  The value at this hotel is ...  ok . <s> It's probably the best you'll find in Chicago ;  though ;  but this is Chicago . <s> Anyway ;   $ 200 / night wasn't so bad and definitely better value than anything else in the area . <s> The staff is at least a couple of notches above the competition ;  everyone I encountered was friendly and responsive . <s> Also ;  surprisingly for a hotel ;  their breakfast was actually edible . <s> A final note :  the bathrooms at this hotel are ridiculous - I could probably live in one and not even need the actual room . <s> Hilton Chicago - I stayed at Hilton Chicago for two nights in April and was not quite impressed . <s> The good thing about the hotel is that it has a great view since it is located by the Michigan Lake but I don't have much comment on that since the lake view rooms were already out when I checked in . <s> The room that I stayed was quite spacious but the decorations and layout was not up to the general Hilton standard . <s> Also the size of the bathroom was on the small side compared to other hotels in Chicago on the same level . <s> The location of the hotel is good for people who wants to tour the city given that the Auditorium Museum ;  an aquarium and some other fun spots are in walking distance . <s> But the dining is a problem here . <s> The grill bar and cafe in the hotel much overpriced and the choice were limited . <s> I also wasn't able to find nice restaurants on yelp close to the hotel so I ended up having my dinner in a distance quite far . <s> Overall ;  itâ€™s a decent hotel but not what I expected for a Hilton standard . <s> My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week  ( in a studio suite ;  which was NOT worth the extra payment )  . <s> It was an absolute NIGHTMARE ! <s> To begin with ;  the room is listed as 'oversized' ;  when it's nothing of the sort . <s> We've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller . <s> I believe the only extra space was in the closet ;  which isn't very useful unless you plan on living there ! <s> We had our two sons with us ;  so we had to make extra sleeping space . <s> Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time ;  complaining of bugs moving around . <s> He must have been umcomfortable also ;  as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock . <s> The room service is horrible ;  they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm ;  and she had to wait up for that . <s> My family would NEVER go back to this hotel ;  and I highly recommend you also stay well away . <s> Omni Chicago Hotel – Our stay here was just ok . <s> Nothing particularly wrong with it ;  but nothing worth paying the extra money for either . <s> I’ll admit that the rooms were nice - large and with a ton of stuff in them ;  but my wife and I don’t really need a full dining table . <s> My main complaint is how they nickel-and-dime you . <s> As expensive as a room is per night ;   $ 55 for parking  ( daily ! <s>  )  is excessive . <s> Travelocity listed them as pet friendly ;  but when they saw my wife’s beagle they tacked on another  $ 50 or so charge . <s> Wifi is free in the lobby ;  so that’s nice at least ;  but to get it in your room you have to pay for it . <s> For an already expensive hotel ;  these types of charges did not make my stay any more enjoyable . <s> Next time I’ll take a better look at surrounding hotels before booking . <s> After booking a room over two months in advance at the Hotel Sofitel Chicago Watertower and confirming my reservation twice ;  I arrived to find that the front desk staff had 'no record' of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that I had reserved . <s> When I asked to speak to a manager ;  it took almost half an hour for him to turn up . <s> He did finally give me a room at the rate that I had been promised ;  but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience . <s> The room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay . <s> Not worth the rate though . <s> The website really makes this hotel seem upscale ;  clean ;  and well decorated ;  but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby . <s> The staff's response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell  ( which could only mean it hadn't been cleaned properly )  was met with contempt . <s> They did move me ;  but I did not get an apology . <s> Will not stay again . <s> Hotel Monaco is in a really great location ;  only a block away from the Miracle mile and a couple of blocks from Millenium Park . <s> Sears Tower is also well within walking distance and if you don't mind walking you won't have a problem walking to Greek Town and Lincoln Park  ( we did )  . <s> The daily ;  complimentary ;  wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out . <s> If you can ;  leave your car behind ;  you won't need it and the parking is quite pricey ;  which is not very surprising considering the location . <s> Everything was clean ;  fresh and modern and the staff very helpful . <s> The only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around  " the loop "  was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning . <s> We stayed at the Hard Rock on January 27th ;  2009 for  $ 125 / night . <s> It is located on Michigan Ave ;  just two blocks from the Mag Mile ;  two blocks from Millenium Park ;  and five blocks from the Chicago Art Institute . <s> Our hotel room was very nice with views of Michigan Ave and a unusually comfy bed . <s> The hotel even offered free coffee in the lobby every morning and free wifi in the rooms . <s> Parking was  $ 45 for valet and  $ 30 for self parking . <s> The staff was very helpful with all of our request . <s> Simply a nice place to stay ... <s> I had a great deal for the room ;  and was impressed with the quality . <s> Hotel staff was very helpful ;  they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes . <s> Negative :  It is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it's the same here ;  you have to pay for the internet . <s> Negative :  Loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone ;  or them shower . <s> The staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding ;  dong ;  ditch . <s> The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay . <s> The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap ;  but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room . <s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - This hotel is awesome ! <s> The rooms are truly beautiful ;  mine had huge windows with a breathtaking view of the Chicago skyline . <s> Looking out the window in the morning as the sun rose over the city was one of the highlights of the whole trip . <s> The bed was quite large ;  maybe a little too large for my tastes since I was travelling alone . <s> For a couple I think it would be perfect . <s> There are also some large nightstands on either side of the bed that are very convenient for putting the contents of your pockets on ;  and they have a built-in ipod charger which was incredibly convenient for me . <s> The one major downside to the room was the placement of the bathroom . <s> The door is too close to the head of the bed . <s> Again since I was travelling alone it wasn't a huge problem ;  but if my wife were with me ;  someone would have gotten blinded by the light from the bathroom during the night . <s> Overall a fairly minor complaint given how excellent my stay was in general . <s> In a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood . <s> A small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby ;  the Pump Room is a classic place to have a drink . <s> We did not have dinner there so I can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood . <s> It is a short walk to very good shopping and eating . <s> A lovely hotel in a trendy part of Chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels . <s> The rooms are very ;  very well appointed ;  but not large ;  and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception . <s> Unfortunately ;  the service was below average in every way :  they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline ;  valets didn't deliver the car and had to be asked twice ;  the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost ;  and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue . <s> It amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours ! <s> And even after recognizing their shortcomings ;  not one sincere or significant apology . <s> A poster child of how bad service cannot overcome a well-built ;  well-furnished hotel . <s> Hyatt Regency Chicago - I thought that the Hyatt Regency in Chicago would be the perfect place to stay in Chicago ;  because of its location and the recent renovations to the hotel . <s> Unfortunately ;  I was not impressed with the slow service during check-in and the inconvenient room service hours . <s> Check-in took over an hour because of the long line ;  and slow moving employees . <s> Additionally ;  room service came to clean my room at 8 in the morning . <s> Overall ;  this was not the worst experience I had at a hotel ;  but I am definitely never staying at the Hyatt again . <s> The Omni Chicago Hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels I have ever had the oppertunity to visit . <s> Not only are the desk clerks very helpful ;  but you feel like a celebrity when you visit . <s> The workout room is great with lots of room so you do not feel cramp . <s> They also have a great indoor pool and a spa . <s> It also comes with 2 sundecks to get a nice tan . <s> If you need a vacation ;  this is the place to stay . <s> Attended a wedding in Chicago ;  Sofitel is new ;  humming ;  very very modern  ( W hotel style - minimalist )  and a great location . <s> However ;  I miss the basics of a less trendy hotel . <s> We checked in at 7 PM and our room wasn't ready - when they gave me a key the maid was still in the room making it up for me !  !  ! <s> I had to wait in the hallway  ....  On the weekend I came back for a nap at about 3 : 30 PM after vacating the room at 8 : 30 AM and it still wasn't made up . <s> The housekeeping line was never answered so had to call front desk to get someone to make up my room . <s> Also called housekeeping for a new hairdryer and they never brought me one .... I gave up ... This is a hot ;  youth hotel but for my next visit ;  I think I'd prefer some of the classic amenities likely timely housekeeping ;  a somewhat larger room that you can walk around ;  and a less trendy ;  hot ;  loud clientele . <s> I'm over 40 . <s> Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park  --  The Fairmont Chicago hotel is nice ;  I guess ;  but I have a hard time justifying spending that much money per night on a little extra comfort . <s> The food in the nearby restaurants was exquisite ;  though also quite pricey  ( but easier to justify for me )  . <s> The rooms seemed well decorated however the lighting was a bit dim ;  I think it was meant to give the rooms a homely feel however all I saw was a nice room whose darkness was a little depressing . <s> It's an undeniably nice hotel ;  but I don't think I'll ever again be willing to part with that much money for marginal increases in comfort . <s> I stayed at the Hard Rock hotel in Chicago last year and can say i was not satisfied with my experience . <s> I feel that it didn't live up to what was advertised and the accommodations were sub-par at best . <s> I had the chance to catch a show and the music was too loud and the sound guy's work resembled that of an amateur . <s> My personal rating is 2 / 5 stars and i would not recommend this hotel to a friend . <s> My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference . <s> We stayed in a spacious suite . <s> All amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape . <s> The bed was very comfortable . <s> Views were great . <s> I love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights . <s> The room was so quiet ;  it was very relaxing . <s> We ate in the restaurant downstairs  ( Aria )  and although pricey ;  it was excellent . <s> The staff were consistently attentive and responsive . <s> It is evident that everyone is very well-trained . <s> I would love to stay here again . <s> Other reviews complain about the small rooms . <s> For a major city ;  we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings . <s> One feature we liked is the ability to open the window . <s> The Knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off Michigan Avenue in the best area of Chicago . <s> The staff was friendly and helpful . <s> For the  $ 116 we paid on Hotwire ;  we could not have found a better room in downtown Chicago . <s> Hyatt Regency Chicago  This was my first trip into Chicago and I have to say that experience was not made better by the Hyatt Regency . <s> I booked this hotel at the recommendation of a friend ;  and even though it was expensive ;  my friend told me it would be worth it . <s> I specifically requested a room facing the river ;  but instead I got a room near to the ground facing the boring office building across the street . <s> When I went to sort out things at the front desk ;  they treated me like a dead fish and tried to placate me with complementary wifi for my stay  ( which never worked )  . <s> The rooms are fine but theyâ€™re not worth the trouble . <s> Iâ€™m never coming back and Iâ€™ll think twice before staying at a Hyatt again . <s> I was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel . <s> The walls were paper thin ;  and I could hear conversations in the next room . <s> This is not something I would have expected from a higher class of hotel . <s> The room was also smaller than I would have expected for the price . <s> We were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room ;  something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning . <s> We requested new towels ;  but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request . <s> The check-in process was frustrating ;  mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter . <s> I don't know if she was having a bad day ;  or just happens to be in such a mood all the time ;  but either way ;  it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with . <s> Overall ;  not a pleasant experience . <s> I think next time ;  we'll choose another hotel to stay at when visiting Chicago . <s> The stunning bay at Chicago finds its equal in the Ambassador East Hotel . <s> This hotel feels like luxury was built into everything ;  down to the wonderful room service and conference rooms . <s> Besides being in an active neighborhood in Chicago ;  the Ambassador East is close enough to the action and beautiful sights Chicago has to offer . <s> The overall service of the hotel was wonderful . <s> I felt like I was treated as a king . <s> The room was very neat ;  regal ;  and relaxing . <s> I especially liked the bathroom as it was clean and soothing . <s> The Pump Room was also a great place for excellent dining . <s> My stay here was completely enjoyable while maintaining a high level of productivity . <s> Overall ;  the stay here was fantastic and worth every penny . <s> I would return to the Ambassador East Hotel in a heartbeat if given the opportunity . <s> This small boutique hotel is tucked away in a perfect location between the Loop and the Miracle Mile . <s> Two blocks west of the Wrigley Building and so convenient to restaurants ;  etc . <s> The staff ;  from doormen to desk folks are extra nice and accommodating . <s> The delicious breakfast on each floor is ultra-convenient ;  the evening happy hour is more than generous ;  and the morning paper is welcome . <s> Bedding is so comfortable . <s> This is our second stay ;  and certainly not our last . <s> We love Chicago ;  and this hotel is one of the reasons why . <s> This is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the Chicago River and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city ! <s> I had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service . <s> If you're looking for a vacation in Chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort ;  I highly recommend this hotel and I would definitely come again ! <s> When I first booked my reservation at this hotel ;  honestly ;  I didn't know what to expect . <s> I mean ;  I'm kind of a music person ;  but this was my first real experience with a musically  " themed "  hotel . <s> Upon staying here ;  however ;  I am convinced that I made the right choice in my stay . <s> The dining accommodations were excellent ;  and I was served probably some of the best food I've ever eaten at a hotel . <s> It was intelligently placed in downtown Chicago ;  and I wouldn't have to walk too far to see some street performers ;  or just take in the majesty of the city itself . <s> The room I had booked had an excellent view of the skyline ;  and I could've easily sat for hours ;  just marveling at the city sprawled out before me . <s> The whole  " Hard Rock "  and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay . <s> If I had to stay here again ;  I would ! <s> We stayed in the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago in a standard guest room . <s> The rooms had just been renovated ;  but the changes did not make much of a difference . <s> The room was so small ;  it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat . <s> The decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room . <s> We were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room ;  but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us ;  there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers . <s> We called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them . <s> It would not have mattered if they sent a second set ;  the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers . <s> As hotel guests ;  we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for . <s> We were severely disappointed . <s> I recently stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and there is no way I'll be going back . <s> Check in took a long time as there many people arriving for a conference and only a single staff member at the reception desk . <s> My room itself was barely passable - the bathroom seemed to need a good cleaning and the room itself looked like it had seen better days long before I ever was here . <s> For the price I was paying ;  you'd think they'd allow access to the work out facilities ;  but they wanted an outrageous PER DAY charge ! <s> Top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you won't want to be spending any time here at all . <s> To top it off ;  the promised discount rate wasn't honored at the end of my stay ;  despite being assured that all was well at check in ! <s> I ended up arguing with the manager about it when I was checking out - since I had to catch a flight ;  no resolution happened and as of yet ;  I'm still waiting for responses to my calls and letters . <s> Chicago has a lot better hotels to offer and for the price per night I paid ;  it wasn't worth it . <s> Even the Shula's wasn't enough to make me want to return here . <s> We spent a week in this hotel and were very pleased with the experience . <s> As described in previous reviews . <s> the room was very comfortable with the huge televison and bathroom being particularly outstanding . <s> Service was excellent overall  ( I especially liked the bottle of water at my bedside with the turn down service )  . <s> The door and bellmen / women were particularly pleasant and helpful and the concierge was friendly and knowledgeable . <s> We had completely satisfactory  ( though overpriced )  drinks in the bar but didn't eat at the restaurant . <s> The health club was fine and the equipment was well maintained . <s> While there were only three treadmills and two elipitical steppers ;  I never had to wait for a machine although it might be a different story in the dead of a Chicago winter ! <s> One minor quibble -- I like to have coffee first thing in the morning and there was no in-room coffee maker . <s> The restaurant offered free coffee  " to-go "  but only before eight AM . <s> This is a very ;  very comfortable ;  attractive hotel in a wonderful location . <s> Chicago is an expensive city but we felt that we got a reasonable value for our money . <s> Overall ;  the hotel was okay . <s> Though I did have a problem with the price . <s> The accommodations mentioned on the website were accurate  ( other than the supposedly luxury mattress ;  it was not more comfortable than my own mattress ! <s>  )  ;  but this hotel offers nothing more than a much more affordable hotel ! <s> There is a difference between the Palmer House Hilton lobby ;  and your normal ;  affordable lobby . <s> But ;  I do not go to a hotel because it has a fancy lobby ;  I go to get a good night's sleep . <s> When I want to sight see ;  I go elsewhere . <s> Like I said ;  overall ;  the hotel was okay ;  but it was not worth the price . <s> I found this hotel in the  " Small Luxury Hotels of the World "  booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years ;  and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels . <s> I therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from England . <s> The Talbott was excellently located ;  although i had a view of a building site ;  and did have an ambience and some charm ;  however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling . <s> I had to wait in the foyer well after check in time ;  having previously attempted to check in earlier ;  tired and in need of a rest ;  while a  " final check "  was done to my room . <s> The valet parking was not outside when requested ;  breakfast was not included in the price ;  all the things requested of reception did not occur ;  and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special . <s> I have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant ;  where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel . <s> I was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all . <s> Advertised as a luxury hotel the Conrad Chicago is more gouge than grand . <s> My wife and I decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in Chicago for our tenth anniversary . <s> After looking at several hotels in the  " Magnificent Mile "  territory of downtown Chicago we selected the Conrad . <s> The Conrad's website impressed us immediately . <s> The pictures of the rooms were lovely ;  they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions ;  not that we were planning to watch much tv . <s> We called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system ;  I was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how I was unable to make my reservations via the automated system . <s> In any case I picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid September . <s> My wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online ;  most impressed with the view . <s> It cost a pretty penny ;  more than I would normally spend on out of town accomidations ;  but her happiness was worth it . <s> Unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the Conrad . <s> Valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage . <s> We spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it . <s> At the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system . <s> I explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost . <s> By the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay . <s> That ended when we found out that our  " view "  was of a back alley service corridor . <s> So much for the skyline . <s> Overall ;  the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow . <s> I hate to be picky but I was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up . <s> The spa had very limited hours as well . <s> Somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams ;  away from the hotel . <s> It was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count . <s> I would not recommend the Conrad Chicago . <s> I would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in Chicago . <s> I was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms ;  but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet . <s> Just returned from a week in Chicago with the family . <s> This hotel was perfect for us . <s> Location is great ;  kids loved the pool as a place to wind down after a day of museums ;  touring ;  ball games ;  etc . <s> We checked in through Hilton Honors Desk as opposed to the regular check in line . <s> Even though our reservations were through priceline at a reduced rate ;  they gave us a pick of the the rooms . <s> The room had a large closet which helped with the amount of gear we had with us . <s> Used valet parking which was hasselfree . <s> We had a great experience and would stay there again . <s> The InterContinental Chicago Hotel is one of the finest hotels I have stayed at in a long time . <s> The atmosphere upon arrival was one of elegance and beauty . <s> The staff welcomed us and catered to our every need . <s> The rooms were plush and very romantic . <s> Interior decor was breathtaking . <s> It is definitely above a 4 star rating and I would not think twice about coming back here . <s> It received my highest recommendation . <s> JAMES HOTEL ;  CHICAGO - REVIEW  It is one of the stylish hotels that can be found in Chicago ;  magnificent mile . <s> Full marks should be given to the hospitality and service . <s> Rooms are furnished spacious and well maintained . <s> Beds are pretty huge and comfortable . <s> Gym equipment’s are sophisticated and complete . <s> It is located at the perfect place being near to cultural places like Millennium Park and Museum of contemporary art . <s> It is pretty near to all the good restaurants like trader Joe which is a good place to have breakfast and basically is nice place to be in . <s> There is also collection of books ;

 large flat-screen television ;  and an entire home office setup ;  I barely had to leave the room . <s> Why would I want to with the amazing views of the lake and entire city . <s> What an amazing experience I had and I will gladly come back . <s> We originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website ;  read about their  " romantic weekend getaway . <s>  "  Having never been in the area before or stayed at an Ambassador Hotel we really didn't know what to expect ;  but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be . <s> Upon arriving ;  the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car ;  unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic . <s> It only went downhill from there . <s> The bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldn't figure out what it was . <s> We ended up getting a different room ;  which was very mediocre . <s> Needless to say ;  we won't be staying here again . <s> For the price of the Marriott we spent a night here  (  $ 122 + tax )  and had an enjoyable if brief stay . <s> As others have noted the hotel has been recently renovated ;  and the rooms are furnished with attractive and sleek scandanavian-type design . <s> The staff was polite and attentive ;  and seemed to match the redesign with a hip kind of feel . <s> The parking is pricey at  $ 49 ;  so I used an adjacent lot and self-parked ;  and as others have noted ;  the lack of water-pressue in the shower was disappointing . <s> Good location . <s> Would return ;  esp as this pricepoint . <s> Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago . <s> We decided to stay at the Talbott ;  and we reserved a room there over a month ago . <s> I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful ;  but the accommodations to be quite disappointing . <s> We were given room  # 1605 . <s> Avoid this room at all costs ! <s> The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night  ( and then awaken you at 6 AM )  . <s> In addition ;  we had requested a king bed ;  and  # 1605 has two doubles . <s> We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room . <s> Despite the very friendly staff and its super location ;  the Talbott was less than what we expected ;  and we would probably not stay there again . <s> The rooms were beautiful ! <s> The staff was friendly and helpful . <s> I love where the Conrad in Chicago was located ;  it seemed to be close to a lot of places I wanted to visit . <s> Chicago was great ;  and the Conrad Hotel made my family and my stay that much more exceptional ! <s> For the price ;  you would think this would be a top quality hotel ;  but it was nowhere close . <s> Service at check-in was slow and unfriendly . <s> The room was even worse . <s> It was small ;  dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though I had requested a non-smoking room . <s> The cover on the bed was stained ;  there was hair all over the bathroom floor ;  and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall . <s> Everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel . <s> I also didn't appreciate having to pay for wifi ;  when other premium hotels offer it for free . <s> Overall ;  this was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in a long time ;  and considering the price ;  it was terrible . <s> I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels ;  however I have never experienced top service as I did at the Hotel Allegro . <s> Even before my visit ;  concierge Mark Kraemer advised us on things to see ;  and booked tickets in advance to Second City . <s> We were welcomed warmly on arrival ;  and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel . <s> All the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience . <s> The hotel is next to City Hall ;  where I had some business . <s> We had a large quiet room ;  and used room service-the meal came quickly ;  and included a a bonus fruit cup . <s> Enjoyed the pasta night  ( 20 dollars for a three course meal )  at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful ;  the main pasta a bit too salty . <s> And that is the only complaint I can make-from start to finish ;  if you want attentive service ;  this is the place to be . <s> Thank you ;  Hotel Allegro ;  for a great stay . <s> I can't wait to return . <s> I was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at Affinia Chicago ! <s> When I arrived to check in ;  my reservation that I had made ;   ( and confirmed )  ;  2 weeks earlier ;  was not in the computer . I had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me . <s> The whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non-stop on her cell phone ;  while the office phone rang off the hook . <s> I had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room . I'll never go back ; dont waste your money . <s> ï»¿Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel ;  I travel a lot on business and consequently stay at a lot of different hotels . <s> Most are mediocre at best ;  and I rarely bother to write a review ;  but the Monaco was a cut above . <s> Nice ;  big rooms ;  well appointed ;  and with a lot of attention to details like high thread-count linens ;  authentic woodwork and upholstery ;  marble counter tops ;  plush carpets and tasteful artwork - gave my room just the right touch of luxury . <s> I was only in town one night ;  but it was a warm evening so I was able to explore the area a little - lots of decent places to eat within an easy walk - no need to take my car out of the parking garage . <s> The only downside was that I was on one of the lower floors and the noise from the street was a little loud . <s> The next time I stay here  ( and I will surely choose this hotel next time Iâ€™m in Chicago )  ;  I will make sure I get a room on one of the upper floors where I imagine the noise will be less intrusive . <s> Homewood Suites- I have to say ;  I wasn't too sure about staying at the Homewood Suites- I've had problems with Hilton Hotels in the past . <s> However ;  I was delightfully surpirsed by my weekend stay here . <s> The rooms were the nicest I've ever stayed at ;  nice and spacious yet cozy . <s> The staff was very helpful ;  I'm not very familiar with Chicago ;  so the doorman gave me some recommendations of where to visit . <s> Not that I had to leave the hotel to enjoy myself- the pool was fantastic and the gym was very stae-of-the-art . <s> My only complaint was the noise from the streets below ;  but that's the price you pay to stay at a hotel so centrally located . <s> I can't wait to find an excuse to go back to Chicago so I can stay here again ! <s> Conrad Chicago - The place looks very fancy and they want you to believe everything is perfect there . <s> It would seem that it's actually not . <s> The Terrace restaurant is very pricey and has nothing really impressive about it . <s> The food was bland . <s> Although the room was okay ;  the service was not . <s> They will charge you for every single service you ask ;  explicitly expect a tip ;  and last but not least will forget about the specifics of your requests . <s> Not something I was used to in this kind of Hotels . <s> This place had character I'll give it that . <s> But it wasn't really my style . <s> Arrived late in the evening . <s> The first room they gave me the TV didn't work . <s> Maintenance took a look at it ;  and couldn't figure it out . <s> Told me I'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician . <s> He then passed some gas and left . <s> Real professional . <s> I phoned the front desk on account of the tv ;  and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first . <s> Horrible striped wall paper ;  dingy ;  and old worn carpet . <s> Bathroom was incredibly small . <s> Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door ;  or the sink . <s> Very cramped . <s> The beds weren't very comfortable either . <s> Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy . <s> Location seem very convenient . <s> I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away . <s> But all of the theatres seemed to be near by ;  if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two . <s> And don't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card . <s> It was about  $ 2 / minute . <s> I knew it would be expensive but wasn't expecting that type of rate . <s> I recently stayed in The James Hotel in Chicago and trust me I will never do it again . <s> When you pay a premium price you'd expect first rate service . <s> Our whole experience was a disaster though short lived b / c we could stay their another second . <s> When we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready . <s> So we had to wait in the lobby with our baggage . <s> When we finally got to the room I wouldn't exactly call it clean but it wasn't to bad . <s> The pictures on the website are nice enough but the furniture is falling apart and probably from Walmart . <s> There was plenty of space for an average person of 5' but I'm 6'4 "  and the beds where smaller than what they said ;  not to mention uncomfortable . <s> We ordered room service and not only did they bring us the wrong order but it took 2 hours . <s> There walls were also paper thin so we got little sleep . <s> The heater helped block out some noise until it stopped working in the middle of the night . <s> So the next morning ;  sore from the uncomfortable bed ;  hungry tired and cold we checked out before we even had our coffee . <s> Stay away ! <s> we chose to stay at this hotel after talking to one of my friends and now i write to tell you we had an excellent stay at the talbott . the staff all very helpful and friendly but let me in particular mark mr tim the concierge who is so professional helpful . <s> and knowledgable . the hotel's location is wonderful-ideal for touring business . <s> The only thing I donâ€™t like is the hotel doesnâ€™t have free wifi . <s> The recently remodeled Affina was amazing - from the 6 choice pillow menu to the stocked  " pantry and refrigerator "  to the brand name bathroom ammenities . <s> Within walking distance to just about everything you could possibly need ;  the Affina is a great hotel . <s> The staff was pleasant and seemed to enjoy their jobs . <s> Having never stayed in downtown Chicago before ;  the Affina over and above exceeded our expectations . <s> Although our trip to Chicago was only for one night ;  we will consider staying at the Affina again for a future visit . <s> My husband and I visited this hotel on our way home from our honeymoon . <s> It's a very nice hotel ;  but the valet parking is very expensive ;   $ 53 . 00 per night was rather high so we opted to park our own car . <s> The pool was very nice ;  and the water was warm . <s> The front desk was very nice and helpful ;  If I ever visited Chicago again I would stay there . <s> We just returned from 4 nights at the Ambassador East . <s> What a gem ! <s> The location in the Gold Coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the Magnificent Mile . <s> There is a train station about 2 blocks away . <s> The room was very comfortable ;  with nice amenities ;  and there is free Internet service on the 2nd floor . <s> Best of all was the bell and lobby staff ! <s> They really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived . <s> I would say that this was the nicest hotel staff I've encountered in all my travels . <s> I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . <s> When we arrived at the hotel ;  the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system  ( I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it )  . <s> After speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked . <s> We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically . <s> I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money . <s> I for one won't be going back to this hotel ! <s> We recently completed our second stay at the Fairmont Chicago . <s> The check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure . <s> That is fine when I am traveling on business ;  but on leisure trips I would appreciate a warmer greeting . <s> The hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay ;  but other than seeing some signage / attendees in the lobby ;  we wouldn't have noticed . <s> This is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators . <s> We stayed in a Parkview Suite so we had a large room with a great view of Millenium Park . <s> The anteroom was well appointed with a sofa ;  coffee table ;  desk ;  mini-bar with sink and coffee maker ;  and dining area . <s> The bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard Fairmont room ;  but maybe slightly larger . <s> The bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard Fairmont room ;  and once again ;  possibly slightly larger . <s> The upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious ;  and several small touches such as a shoe shine station  ( with extra collar tabs )  ;  are peppered throughout . <s> We booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled . <s> The hotel restaurant ;  Aria ;  couldn't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us . <s> They had no problem seating us and the dinner  ( both food and service )  was lovely . <s> Minor complaints :  The pillows could be better . <s> I'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit ;  but seriously ;  these things barely felt like pillows . <s> I'll suffer through some congestion if I can get better neck support . <s> Also ;  the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car  ( and charge you  $ 49 )  . <s> And as I mentioned above ;  the front desk experience could be improved . <s> Best feature :  After our first stay ;  I gave a brief review in the comments section of the Fairmont President's Club  ( membership is free )  website . <s> I received a phone call from the Director of Rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience . <s> After this stay ;  I left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay ;  but still received a warm ;  friendly phone call from the Director of Rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay . <s> Kudos to the Fairmont for taking its customers seriously ;  and for that ;  they've won my loyalty . <s> Millenium-I traveled to Chicago for a business trip ;  and I ended up staying at the Millenium . <s> The front desk was rude to me ;  and it took me a good 15 minutes to check in . <s> Both the restaurant and bar are overpriced ;  and the food isn't even that good for the price . <s> And even though I specifically asked for a room with a lake view ;  I was given one that faced the city . <s> The room was average sized ;  and the bathroom wasn't anything impressive ;  despite what everyone seems to be saying . <s> Would not visit again . <s> I was looking for an unique ;  hip experience in a hotel that offered the convenient location of downtown Chicago . <s> My choice for hotel was obvious :  Hard Rock Hotel Chicago . <s> If you are wondering whether Hard Rock Hotels are schmaltzy or cliche ;  they are not . <s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago is modern ;  trendy and hip . <s> It had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories ;  and there are details that you won't find elsewhere . <s> For example ;  one interesting perk is some free iTunes downloads  ( I got ten )  for guests . <s> It's a fun place ;  hosting events such as Jack Daniel's 160th birthday . <s> We booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline ;  paid  $ 85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown Chicago . <s> The location is great . <s> The hotel minimally OK> Unsure how it gets a 4* rating . <s> It is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift . <s> Staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay . <s> However I would NOT recommend this hotel . <s> I would rather have paid  $ 100 and got something more updated - trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case . <s> My suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 * BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GET ..... NOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE .  !  ! <s> IN MY OPINION . <s> beautiful place with European charm . <s> No complaints ;  great location ;   ( never like parking in Chicago ;  though )  . <s> It was  $ 35 a night next door . <s> Large beautiful lobby ;  a touch of class . <s> Fantastic location for downtown ;  Navy Pier ;  and the great Grant Park ( Millenium Park ;  too )  ... Loved it . <s> James Chicago-I had a very relaxing stay at the James . <s> The hotel is in a prime location near the Millenium Park ;  restaurants and the famous Mag Mile . <s> My room was very spacious with a cool ;  hip design and a great skyline view . <s> The interior vibe ;  from the lighting and the sleek woodtone ;  was calming . <s> The bathroom was well-maintained and instant hot water and fresh toiletries were readily available . <s> They also provided pillow options and room plants on request and the bed was perfect . <s> I was pleasantly suprised to find chocolate treats placed on the bed after returning from a day of shopping . <s> I made full use of the fully equipped gym and liked that the restaurant had vegan options . <s> Overall I was impressed by the quality of service from the chauffeur-driven Audi for shopping to the food and exercise options and I look forward to my next visit ! <s> I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago . <s> My stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff . <s> I needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy . <s> The bed was so nice and soft ! <s> Even the pillows were fluffy . <s> I was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe . <s> The local restaurants were amazing . <s> I will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future . <s> This hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood . <s> The owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an  " upscale "  overpriced boutique hotel . <s> But it's still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job . <s> Stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse ;  but with all the sleaze removed . <s> Definitely stay at the chain's other location ;  the Burnham ;  for a much ;  much nicer hotel . <s> We just got back from a great weekend in Chicago and have no complaints about the Palmer House . <s> It's very easy to get to from O'hare ( the Blue line on the EL train )  and then just a 2 block walk from the train station . <s> The hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help . <s> We booked an air / hotel package deal on Expedia . <s> We expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only  $ 45 extra per night we upgraded to the Excutive level ! <s> Best decision of the trip . <s> We had a beautiful room with a King bed ; down comforter ; robes ; plush towels etc ... it also included a nice Continental breakfast each morning ; all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour ! <s> We took advantage of this every day . <s> The location was great .. lots of shopping along State St .  and to get to the Magnificent Mile was a  $ 5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk ! <s> We'll be back to Chicago and the Palmer House ! <s> A disappointment to say the least . <s> I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out ! <s> I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night . <s> The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card ;  since they do indeed take American Express . <s> I couldn't wait to get there ! <s> We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 3 : 00 on Saturday afternoon . <s> Me ;  the tourist ;  I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding . <s> We get in the line to check in . <s> I give them the gift card and my check card . <s> They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate ;  but for incidentals as well . <s> We give them a credit card instead . <s> While in line checking in ;  we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like . <s> The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man . <s> Someone's luggage has been lost . <s> He desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see . <s> Not impressed . <s> We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see . <s> The rooms on the website looked glorious ! <s> My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room . <s> The sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room . <s> Yuck . <s> We stay the night and go to check out in the morning . <s> Again ;  I give them the American Express gift card . <s> The clerk says  " their system usually doesn't take them "  . <s> I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday . <s> He swipes the card and bam ! <s> it works ! <s> What do you know ?  ? <s> He was so rude . <s> I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again ;  nor would I recommend it to anyone . <s> Such a disappointment ! <s> I have stayed at the Omni off an on over the years . <s> On business ;  for personal trips . <s> This trip started off quite rocky ;  and left me very un-impressed . <s> 1 )  Be aware ;  they have a new policy where they charge debit card  $ 55 per day for  " incidentals "  which you *may* incur . <s> They do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card . <s> Even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance . <s> The desk clerk claimed  " all the hotels do this now "  ... funny how when I put a remote employee at the O'Hare hilton on my business debit card ;  I was never asked for additional funds . <s> Having a policy is one thing ;  spreading blame for it is another . <s> While not a problem for me ;  someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this  " policy "  of theirs . <s> To my knowledge ;  they never did this sort of thing before . <s>  ( I don't use Credit Cards ;  its why I have money in a recession . <s> = )  )  2 )  Rooms were clean ;  but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list . <s> The only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water  ( about 600 ML )  for  $ 7 . 50 . <s> As such ;  be careful with the tray of goodies . <s> If the water is  $ 7 . 50 ;  imagine what the snickers bar might cost . <s> 3 )  Our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken ;  and would not move . <s> Calling the front desk resulted in  ...  nothing . <s> Finally about 9 : 00 PM I elected to have another look at it ;  and it seemed to be off its track . <s> I was able to successfully  " fix "  it ;  but the lack of response from maintenance ;  considering the rate for a suite ;  is sad . <s> I remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive . <s> 4 )  The seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now . <s> Overall ;  I think I will be skipping the Omni ;  and they will get no more of my business . <s> It seems Hilton treats people better overall . <s> It's quite sad ;  as I have a lot of good memories with Omni . <s> I will not be back . <s> I made reservations with the Chicago Fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in June . <s> I received no written confirmation with cancelation policy ;  etc . <s> However ;  when I attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first night's reservation ;  I was told that they would charge me for one nights stay . <s> They have a  " 3pm THE DAY BEFORE your first nights stay "  policy . <s> Even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy . <s> This is not a common policy on Michigan Ave . <s> I'd advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy . <s> It was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel ! <s> This was a wonderful stay . <s> The staff was extremely helpful  ;  The rooms are especially large ;  and the fact they have a small kitchen makes everything a lot more easy . <s> The breakfast and supper were excellent . <s> They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - for instance ;  they have take-away plates you can take up to your room . <s> the business center ;  gym and pool also make this my first choice next time in Chicago . <s> The air-condition has a noisy fan / compressor in each room . <s> It starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up . <s> At least the first night . <s> This is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced . <s> The postal service at the hotel is non-working . <s> The hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by UPS . <s> The tickets were at the Hotel General Managers office . <s> The reception denied that they had arrived . <s> We had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it . <s> The Hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience . <s> The concert was the reason for our travel to Chicago . <s> Else ;  the Hotel had good standard ;  free internet in the lobby ;  not to good view from the rooms ;  and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars . <s> We had booked 20 room-nights all together staying at room 612 ;  425 and 431 from the 23rd June . <s> We recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park while travelling for business . <s> What an incredible experience ! <s> Friends had stayed there years ago ;  but when we showed them our photos ;  they couldn't believe the amazing renovations . <s> While we loved the modern decor and style ;  our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call Fairmont PURE rooms . <s> I have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling ;  so I wasn't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room . <s> I have to say I felt great during our entire stay . <s> We enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at Eno . <s> What a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel . <s> This hotel is truly beautiful ;  everything you would expect from a high-end ;  big city hotel . <s> Our stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park didn't disappoint us in any respect . <s> Our only disappointment ? <s> We don't have a reason to go back to Chicago anytime soon ;  but I have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future . <s> I stayed at the Hilton Chicago because I was attending a conference at the hotel . <s> The room was sufficient - had a coffee maker ;  bed ;  hangers ;  tv ;  etc . <s> That's about where my compliments end :  *restaurant rates are outrageous . <s>  $ 21 for a breakfast buffet ? <s>  $ 25 to use the gym ? <s>  $ 7 . 50 / hr for WiFi !  ?  !  ?  ! <s> This is unacceptable when I'm paying  $ 249 per night . <s> Thank goodness the ice was free . <s> *servers in the restaurant and bar were surly ;  not well-versed in English ;  and just rude . <s> *computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night *conference was incredibly cold ... everybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time ;  despite our complaints to management . <s> *fridge in room was not usable . <s> had to store cold items in the ice bucket . <s> *Cable channels just flat out SUCKED . <s> I was soooo bored when I had to spend an hour in my room . <s> If I'm paying that much ;  at least provide the full 70 channels . <s> My husband and I stay at the Amalfi every year for our anniversary . <s> We just love it ! <s> The service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly . <s> The hotel has very good cuisine options ;  which are all very tasty ! <s> The hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there . <s> The rooms are very comfortable and quiet . <s> Perfect for relaxing ! <s> Will definitely keep coming back ! <s> I was looking for a fun ;  contemporary hotel and it didn't deliver . <s> The lobby was nice ;  and the rooms were mostly clean ;  but it really wasn't special . <s> Service time was slow for room requests ;  I found empty water bottles under the chair ;  and the a <s> Stayed for 3 nights for our anniversary . <s> The desk clerk was great and since it was our anniversary ;  he gave us an upgrade ... imagine our surprise when we got off on a floor with only 3 other rooms ! <s> Corner tower suite with a view of the river and Michigan ave .  Beautiful ! <s> Cabs available right outside the lobby ...  Never paid more than  $ 7 for a cab ride . <s> If you go in Dec .  you must go to the ChrisKindl Festival for strudel ! <s> We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August . <s> We waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open ;  this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two's . <s> Our room had a great view of Navy Pier and was a good size . <s> The bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean . <s> The location of the hotel is the best ;  we walked to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . <s> The breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two . <s> Would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again . <s> My husband  &  I stayed at the Fitzpatrick in early June 2004 for my birthday-great hotel ! <s> Location provides easy walking to Navy Pier ;  Marshall Field ;  Michigan Avenue  &  John Hancock . <s> Room seemed spacious even though its only about 300 sq ft .  Lots of room in bathroom ;  comfortable bed ;  very quiet ;  upscale hotel . <s> We would definitely stay here again ! <s> Great location and quality place to stay . <s> Lovely large clean room with a queen size bed it was great . <s> Staff were very helpful and put us onto some great restaurants and then some music bars . <s> Coleman on the front desk was a great guy to meet as a first impression he sold the hotel to us with his personality . <s> The hotel delivered an anniversary cake to us in our room  ( compliments of the hotel )  for me this showed that they care about their guests Many thanks to all it was a great place to stay . <s> Very pleasant front staff ;  wine in the evening in the lobby ;  large rooms ;  great rates ;  and free Internet for those that are members of the loyalty program . <s> Overall an excellent value . <s> Close to the El for those coming in from either Midway or O'Hare airports . <s> Since this was our first visit to the  " windy city ;  "  we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique . <s> We read many great reviews regarding the Kimpton brand so we gave it a go . <s> The  " go "  ended up being a  " no go . <s>  "  We were sorely disappointed . <s> When we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice . <s> We have two kids with us ;  so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby . <s> We were told  " no problem . <s>  "  Unfortunately ;  it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next . <s> Then ;  we noticed a bug  ( or bugs )  near the fridge area . <s> Yikes ! <s> We called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room  ( or floor !  )  . <s> Our request was met about 30 minutes later . <s> By this time ;  we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions ;  we almost wanted to throw the towel in . <s> Customer service was so lacking ! <s> We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city ;  but had to wait around for our new room and the crib . <s> This is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price ! <s> Will have to think hard before we book with a Kimpton hotel again . <s> I went to stay at this hotel last year . <s> I have got to say it was a great authentic experience ;  the dining Restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff . <s> Its location couldn't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping . <s> Looking at it from the outside at night is very beautiful . <s> It is very affordable . <s> I recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town . <s> http :  /  / www . swissotelchicago . com /  - My room was large ;  clean ;  and well furnished with a great view of the Chicago River . <s> The hotel was located in the heart of Chicago ;  directly next to the Magnificent Mile . <s> However ;  there was some city noise that was noticeable at night . <s> This didn’t bother me ;  and overall my stay was very pleasant . <s> If you have the money ;  Amalfi Hotel is the place for you . <s> All the way from it's 316 thread count ;  Egyptian linens to the 24 hour fitness center . <s> This hotel has anything you would need or want . <s> The rooms are equipped with free wi-fi ;  32in plasma televisions ;  multi-head showers and much ;  much more . <s> You can do anything from fine dining and wine to working on the computers in the business center ;  which is equipped with computers free to your use . <s> After a long night at the bar ;  you can get a complimentary breakfast at each floor . <s> Over all the service is great as well . <s> I recommend this hotel to any one from business professionals to young singles looking for a good time . <s> I plan on coming back very soon . <s> A decent place to stay . <s> The people are nice enough ;  yet the atmosphere was not what I was expecting . <s> The rooms were not very spacious ;  nor welcoming . <s> So many places to eat ;  yet the food was very pricey and average . <s> I would stay here again possibly ;  but I feel like I could find a better option for a better price . <s> I have just returned from my first stay at the remodeled Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and all I can say is fabulous ! <s> The modern decor and style hits you the minute you walk in . <s> The front desk is a work of art . <s> I stayed in the anything but standard guestroom . <s> The modern decor ;  the beautiful artwork ;  this is the most relaxing hotel room I have ever stayed in . <s> The bathroom is like having your own personal spa ;  all the marble tile is classic and modern at the same time . <s> The rainfall showerhead is to die for people . <s> If you have the time be sure to check out the fitness center and spa . <s> Great new equipment to work up a sweat and all the pampering a body could ever needs awaits in the spa . <s> I wish I could have stayed longer ;  next time I will be sure to add a couple of  " me "  days to my trip and I'm sure I won't even think of going outside those doors . <s> This is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities . <s> Everyone was helpful . <s> The breakfast buffet was wonderful . <s> The bed was  " just like home "  . <s> We would definitely stay again . <s> A nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home . <s> It was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best . <s> I travelled to Chicago last week with my daughter for some Christmas shopping . <s> We booked the Conrad based on the reviews on Tripadvisor . <s> It lived up to all expectations . <s> Great big room ;  with two king size beds . <s> Very comfortable . <s> Breakfast was great ;  loads of choice and plenty on the plate . <s> Great location ;  connected to a shopping mall which was very useful the day it snowed . <s> All and all ;  a great hotel and we would go back in the morning . <s> Chicago is a great city with very friendly people . <s> When I first looked at the Hotel Monaco Chicago - a Kimpton Hotel's website ;  the hotel looked very pleasing and a great place for me to stay during my visit to Chicago . <s> The problems began when I called to make a reservation . <s> The woman who answered was very rude ;  to say the least . <s> I had a few questions about the spa services . <s> She rushed through what sounded like she was reading through a brochure . <s> I decided that I shouldn't let one person ruin my experience with the hotel so I made a reservation and soon I was in Chicago . <s> The front desk service was very pleasant when I arrived ;  and the room seemed clean ;  other than the mysterious stain on my bedsheets . <s> I got dressed up and went down to the bar area for a drink and appetizers . <s> It took over thirty minutes for any worker to approach me for an order . <s> Yet two other parties that walked in after me were served right away . <s> I was baffled considering I was dressed nice and in a fairly good mood considering it was my first trip to Chicago . <s> Needless to say I will not be staying at this hotel again . <s> Conrad Chicago â€“ review I stayed at Deluxe suite in Conrad Chicago for one night with my mother . <s> I do appreciate its living room ;  separate with the bedroom so that while my mom was watching TV I could do my stuff in the bedroom without being disturbed . <s> Through the window in the bedroom ;  I was able to see a rather good city view ;  especially the night view . <s> Rather good experience in this hotel~ <s> This is an older hotel ;  and the age shows . <s> Rooms are small ;  and a bit drab . <s> Bathroom in my room was in urgent need of upgrade . <s> Bed was comfortable ;  though ;  and the room was quiet ;  Hotel staff was polite ;  but not really interested in the guest . <s> Even the concierge was disinterested . <s> Check-in was irritatingly slow for the few number of people in line . <s> Really ;  a hotel tjhat promises so much in its promotional material should deliver better . <s> The hotel really didnt seem to be trying . <s> The hotel is staffed by very nice but many inexperienced people . <s> Executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours . <s> Other areas similarly lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel . <s> One of the individuals at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place . <s> While the location is good ;  this particular hotel is simply not a good representation of what Swissotel is supposed to be ;  and there are far better choices in Chicago . <s> It would not be my choice for a return stay . <s> This hotel is absolutely amazing . <s> I have paid to stay in Hotels that cost an arm and a leg only to get crappy service in return . <s> However ;  here it's comfortable ;  friendly ;  and a vacation . <s> In fact ;  all vacations start with your lodging ;  and how can you have a good vacation with poor lodging ? <s> The beds are comfortable ;  clean ;  and upscale ;  while still being homey enough to be relaxed . <s> The services and staff are tops ;  and the view from the rooms is absolutely gorgeous ! <s> And I must commend the cleanliness ! <s> Nice place to stay ;  and worth every penny ! <s> Will definitely be coming back ! <s> Fairmont Chicago - Last week ;  conference of parties'13 took place in Chicago . <s> They invited me as the guest speaker ; provided accommodation at Fairmont Chicago and glad to see eco-friendly standards observed in the premises . <s> Aria restaurant ;  Eno Wine Room are good enough to satiate desires and Grant Park is right infront of the hotel to burn the consumed calories . <s> Since ;  it's in the heart of the city ;  lobby's are a bit noisy but rooms are well equipped with noise-reduction stuff so that I prepared ppt's peacefully without much disturbance . <s> Hoping them to provide the same accommodation for next year's conference as well . <s> The location of this hotel was superb ! <s> Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular . <s> The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect . <s> One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter . <s> We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same . <s> We were checked into a room with empty beer bottles ;  dirty underwear in the closet and unclean bathroom . <s> There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints . <s> We missed our show because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc . <s> Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles especially when I had a child and a teenager with me she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience !  !  ! <s> Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night . <s> They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets . <s> I asked for two blanket  ;  but they delivered one . <s> I had to keep calling to get settled . <s> I saw a comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk ;  who had taken the trouble of filling it out ;  but no one collected it or cared for it . <s> ht . <s> Noisy rooms . <s> Can hear the doors all night . <s> Thebreakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished . <s> I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates !

<s> The filet mignon seems to be 1 / 2 the thickness of what I have seen and it was tough . <s> I thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow ?  ?  ?  ? <s> Also ;  the crab cakes was a bit too salty . <s> Finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking . <s> In asking my co-worker ;  most seem to be blase about the food . <s> However ;  some seem to like the burger  ( which they went to substitute )  at the Palms ;  which is a restaurant inside the hotel ;  just off the lobby . <s> On the positive note ;  the dessert for dinner was good . <s> Otherwise ;  I'd recommend another hotel . <s> In the meantime ;  when I got home ;  I make sure to bring EVERYTHING straight to the washer / dryer to disinfect  ( even strip down )  . <s> But ;  damn ;  I'm still itchin' <s> The Amalfi Hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating ;  but that's about it . <s> When my wife and I got here ;  we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned ! <s> The Internet access promised on the hotel's website was down ;  so I couldn't catch up on any of the business I had intended to do ;  and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic ;  like she was sleeping inside a Salvador Dali painting . <s> All in all ;  this hotel was not worth the money ;  especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city -- something more casual and comfortable would have been better ;  and it would probably have been cleaner ;  too ! <s> This hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means . <s> Incompetent service . <s> Hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday . <s> Elevators were very slow ;  waited 10 minutes on any given event . <s> Red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night . <s> Used my stay toward NW airlines bonus points . <s> Bar was ok .  One cup coffee service was awful . <s> No free wireless and no free cable channels . <s> Fridge was 25 bucks a day to use . <s> With http :  /  / hotels . com res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect .  ?  .... <s> Location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to outweigh the negatives . <s> The Hilton Chicago ;  located on prime real estate in downtown Chicago ;  has not aged as gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time . <s> The hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic ;  but that luxury is not in accord with 21st century standards . <s> Lacking any form of fitness center ;  the Hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of Chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout . <s> Even nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this point ;  and the outrageous parking fee of  $ 43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making the Hilton their destination . <s> Most guest rooms are no different than any other Hilton anywhere ;  meaning that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic Executive suites ;  you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience . <s> My husband and I stayed here at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago a few months back . <s> I wasn't particularly impressed with their customer service . <s> When we arrived to check in ;  the front desk clerk was quite rude and unfriendly . <s> She was short with me when I asked her about the city's attractions and things to do . <s> Our room wasn't all that great either . <s> It was rather small and had a weird smell to it . <s> I won't be staying here again . <s> Just returned to Seattle after a visit home to Chicago and I loved The James !  !  ! <s> Recently stayed at the Ritz at Water Tower and the Dana around the corner -- both of which were great but The James was perfect . <s> Secured the room through a package w /  American Express for a great deal so though the view wasn't great the space ;  decor and location can't be beat . <s> Staff was friendly ;  courteous and very helpful ;  the gym was substantial and though I didn't try the restaurants / room service ;  the menus looked yummy . <s> I've stayed in Chgo in that area on avg 1-2s / mo over the past three years and the James is at the top my list now . <s> If you can get a good deal ;  I highly recommend !  ! <s> Conrad Chicago is one of the nicer hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in recently . <s> The rooms were well furnished and brightly lit ;  but not to the point of garishness . <s> The convenient location was a plus . <s> My stay at the Homewood Suites was absolutely one of my greatest stays away from home . <s> The locations right in the heart of downtown Chicago . <s> Within the River north shopping district .

You have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of Michigan Ave ;  but its not too bad . <s> Be prepared for some sad sights after dark . <s> Apparently panhandling is permitted in Chicago  (  some cities will give you a ticket for begging )  because at night ;  the beggars come out . <s> The saddest thing i saw was an older woman with her two grandkids sitting on a curb in the freezing snow on a -5 temp night . <s> Those kids looked terrible . <s> Unfortunatly its all up and down the wealthiest part of the city . <s> You don't see so many in the daylight . <s> Also the room service at the Hard Rock is pretty good . <s> Its plenty for 2 people . <s> I would not stay here again though . <s> I suggest the Omni Hotel . <s> Great location in Chicago downtown . <s> The staff is professional and warm . <s> The room is spacious and clean . <s> Nice complimentartry breakfast . <s> I will definitely stay here again next time in Chicago . <s> Stayed at the Amalfi hotel in Chicago this month with good expectations . <s> And what a disappointment ! <s> Paid just under  $ 200 for a  " deluxe king "  ;  and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction ;  a dirty ;  badly  " rehabbed "  bathroom ;  itchy sheets ;  no down comforter !  ! <s>  ( just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing )   ;  previously opened bottles in our mini bar ;  and plenty of rude ;  inexperienced staff members  &  managers  ( def . <s> not a 3 or 4 star staffing !  ! <s>  )  I do live in Chicago ;  and have stayed at a wide range of places . <s> I know that for  $ 200 in February ;  you can expect a great hotel . <s> As there were many available the weekend we stayed at Amalfi ;  choosing it over say ;  the Palmer House Hilton ;  Hotel Sax ;  Sutton Place ;  Hotel 71 ;  was a huge waste . <s> Definitely keep looking and book elsewhere . <s> Not worth the price at all ;  don't let their pictures fool you . <s> Also ;  I wouldn't say that our experience was just a rare mishap ;  the hotel looks like an old Days Inn that had undergone a slight renvation ;  i . e . <s>  ;  new lamps . <s> Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park-  " I stayed at Fairmont Chicago a week ago for vacation and I absolutely enjoyed my stay . <s> I got a room on 8th floor and the view of Lake Shore Drive and the lake was stunning . <s> A good part is that it is very close to downtown so you can leave your car behind and walk safely . <s> The rooms are spacious and clean . <s> I dined at Aria restaurant and the food is great !  ! <s> a bit pricy though !  ! <s> There are cheaper options available outside . <s> The staff was courteous and helping . <s> Would love to stay here again . <s>  "  <s> The rates at The Talbott Hotel were cheaper than I had expected ;  and that was my reason for booking a room . <s> I had been prepared for service and a room similar to what I had experienced in the past ;  and I was quite pleased when I did stay . <s> The room was neat and clean ;  and the halls were quiet at night . <s> The traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either . <s> I did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely ;  which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy ;  especially at night . <s> Overall I had no problems with The Talbott Hotel and I would stay at this here again if I were in the area a second time . <s> Stayed at the Chicago Affinia Dec 10 thru Dec 12 and was very impressed with the staff ;  the room ;  and the location . <s> Close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great . <s> Of course ;  there were many other restaraunts nearby as well . <s> I had a little trouble figuring out the heat ;  but it was fine once I learned how to set it . <s> They were working on the hotel ;  so we got a great rate . <s> But the work never bothered us . <s> The room was great ;  with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise . <s> I would definately stay here again and would recommend to others . <s> Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown- I went here on a long weekend that I expected to be relaxing ;  but ended up being very disappointed . <s> The hotel has a nice location in the city ;  but outside of that ;  there were few positives . <s> The room looked as though it had barely been cleaned ;  the water pressure in the shower was terrible ;  and the complimentary breakfast was mainly runny eggs and cool pancakes . <s> The staff at the hotel seemed to pay very little attention to us ;  and any requests we had . <s> Although the location of the hotel is great ;  there are plenty of other nearby hotels with better food ;  better service ;  and nicer rooms . <s> I recently stayed at the Omni Chicago Hotel and it was awful . <s> When I arrived my room was not ready . <s> Two hours later when it was finally cleaned ;  I entered and saw they they had not brought the cot that I had requested for my son . <s> I asked for it again ;  but they never brought it . <s> My mattress was uncomfortable ;  and I did not like sharing it with my son . <s> The AC did not even work and it was terribly hot in the room . <s> The next morning we ate the continental breakfast before leaving ;  and it too was bad . <s> There was cereal ;  low quality yogurt ;  and burnt flavorless muffins . <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . <s> The Palmer House Hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence . <s> The rooms are beautifully decorated ;  with class and superior quality furniture . <s> The hotels restaurant  " lockwood "  consist's of delicious French and Italian cuisine . <s> The location is in the prime area to downtown ;  and shopping areas . <s> This hotel is suited for pristine guests ;  and those who are not willing to settle for less . <s> If you're looking for not just any stay ;  but a stay in luxury ;  you should give The Palmer House Hilton a try . <s> It is one of the best of the best in Chicago ;  and your stay will be one to remember . <s> The Inter Continental is a great hotel . <s> The staff was very friendly ;  and the accomidations were great . <s> The room was clean and ready on time ;  and the indoor swimming pool was perfect considering Chicago's weather . <s> Eno was simply AMAZING . <s> Their wine selection is second to none . <s> And the Turkey Pumpkin Curry at Zest was to die for . <s> My husband and I and our 10 month old took a quick trip to Chicago . <s> We stayed one night at The Palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel . <s> I guess I am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel . <s> Yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small I couldn't set up a pack and play for my son . <s> I had to call and  " upgrade "  my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep . <s> The lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a Holiday Inn . <s> The wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty . <s> I will NEVER stay there again . <s> I found my stay at the Hotel Monaco - Chicago to be less than satisfactory . <s> They lure you in with a fancy website ;  promising the world and more ;  but their services and amenities turned out to be a facade . <s> The pictures on the website show a grand five-star lobby and one would assume the rooms match ;  but when I received my room  ( which by the way I could barely afford )  I found it to be no more luxurious than my local Motel 6 . <s> They mention that they are  " pet friendly "  . <s> Let me tell you ;  that is code for  " smelly "  . <s> There was a faint urine smell throughout the entire hotel and I was awake all night because of the incessant barking . <s> Would not stay again . <s> Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed at . <s> I travel a lot for my job ;  and it just so happened that this was the hotel the company was paying for . <s> Four star hotel ? <s> Yeah right ! <s> I wish I could give it negative stars I don't even know where to begin . <s> Normally with these reviews I try to outline the aspects that stood out ;  but it's just so overwhelmingly bad . <s> Anyhow ;  here it goes :  To begin with ;  the customer service stank . <s> You think you've seen rude service people before ? <s> Well ;  this is customer service stuff of nightmares . <s> I had a reservation ;  but I still had to wait for 30 minutes  ( yes ;  I counted )  for someone just to pay attention to me . <s> When she did ;  finally ;  she was chewing gum . <s> No visible uniform or name tag . <s> Clearly didn't want to be here . <s> She took one glance at my reservation ;  didn't enter anything into the computer at all ;  and told me that they couldn't accept it ;  because the date had already passed . <s> WHAT ? <s> The date for the reservation I had written down was *that day . <s> * I was furious . <s> After a 20 minute shouting match ;  and an equally incompetent manager that left me so angry I could scream ;  they finally ;  grudgingly accepted my name and reservation into the computer ;  so that I could book my room . <s> Then ;  there was the room itself . <s> On first glance ;  it appeared clean ;  but a closer inspection revealed :  black mold on the bathroom ceiling ;  a sink tap that gushed rusty-looking *brown* water ;  a minibar which was picked at ;  the remnants looking like they had been there for several years ;  and a mattress with a mysteriously disgusting yellow stain on it . <s> The pillowcases also looked yellowed ;  but I couldn't decide if I was beginning to see things ;  I was already so upset with the place . <s> After an extremely sleepless night of paper walls and neighbors who were ;  apparently ;  elephants ;  I can easily say that I would NEVER go back to that hotel again . <s> Ever . <s> Not if somebody payed me . <s> Hyatt Regency Chicago  I recently stayed in one of the Respire rooms of the Hyatt Regency in Chicago ;  and I have to say that it lived up to its description . <s> My allergies are especially bad ;  which makes my regular business trips into Chicago miserable affairs . <s> A couple of nights of good rest thoughâ€”which I never get anywhere elseâ€”and I felt much better . <s> That the room was excellent on top of that was simply a cherry on top . <s> The room was comfortably and tastefully furnished and room service was some of the best Iâ€™ve had and made it worth staying in . <s> I recommend the Hyattâ€™s Respire rooms to anyone who suffers from allergies like I do and needs the reprieve . <s> My wife and I stayed at Homewood Suites while on vacation . <s> We had a wonderful experience ;  and couldn't have been happier with our visit . <s> The location ;  right in middle of downtown Chicago ;  is perfect . <s> The hotel was spotlessly clean ;  well maintained ;  and had a great feel to it . <s> The staff were all very helpful and friendly . <s> We definitely plan to stay here again . <s> Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park - We stayed at Fairmont for 3 days and 2 nights and this was the most modern fashionable hotel I've ever stayed . <s> We were really impressed with range of services they offered - valet and concierge ;  ticket services for theater and sporting events ;  baby-sitting service ;  multi-lingual staff and even a foreign currency exchange inside hotel premises . <s> Our room included a 42â€ flat screen TV ;  iPod docking station ;  dressing area with a large closet ;  high speed wireless Internet access and had a stunning view of the Chicago lakefront from our room . <s> We'll recommend this hotel to all our family and friends . <s> The Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago is a fantastic up-scale hotel to stay in while visiting the Windy City . <s> My fiancee and I enjoyed one of the king rooms on our recent stay . <s> The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful - some of the best I've ever dealt with when traveling ;  and valet parking is always a perk ! <s> The rooms were very nice and had all the amenities you would want when at a high-end hotel . <s> The bed was extremely comfortable ! <s> There was cable TV ;  of course ;  and HBO was included ;  so there was always something to watch . <s> Wireless internet signal was excellent and I had no trouble getting online . <s> We had dinner in the hotel restaurant twice during our stay ;  and the food was fantastic ! <s> Great atmosphere as well - we usually only do the hotel restaurant one night on a stay ;  but this one was worth going back to ! <s> Overall ;  it was an incredible stay ;  and we hope to stay at the Ambassador East again next time we're in Chicago ! <s> My recent stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago couldn't have gone worse . <s> Apart from the price of staying there and the slow response time of hotel staff I was totally let down by the food that could be found there . <s> There are many attractions in the area and indeed leaving the hotel is the best part of the experience . <s> HyattRegencyChicago-I was recently in town on business and my company made reservations at the Hyatt . <s> The rooms were comfortable without being extravagant ;  and always kept clean and tidy . <s> The staff was quite attentive and friendly ;  which is always nice to see ! <s> The in-house food options were decent  ( nothing special really )  ;  but the cocktails at Big Bar were surprisingly delicious . <s> All in all I would love to stay again ;  hopefully on a more relaxed schedule this time ! <s> The Palmer House Hilton hotel has it all for the business and leisure traveler out there ! <s> I stayed at this hotel on business and all I can say is WOW !  !  ! <s> One of the main things that I liked about the hotel was the indoor pool ! <s> I loved being able to go swimming even though it was December and 5 degrees outside ! <s> Also ;  the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings . <s> I dined at Lockwood Restaurant and Bar and the food was amazing for a hotel ! <s> One thing that was a minor negative is that pets are allowed and my original room was next door to a barking dog ;  but the hotel staff was fantastic as switched up my room so I didn't have to deal with that ! <s> All in all ;  this hotel was fantastic and I look forward to the next time I get to stay here ! <s> Do NOT stay at this hotel ! <s> A friend and I booked a 3-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in Chicago . <s> Though it was a bit pricy ;  we decided on the Knickerbocker because it was in a great location ;  and the rooms looked large and well-kept . <s> Our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time . <s> However ;  despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay ;  when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an HOUR until we were allowed up to our room . <s> The concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us ;  and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late . <s> To top it off ;  the maid service was terrible . <s> The only thing they seemed to do was make the bed ;  no vacuuming ;  no fresh towels ;  etc . <s> We didn't want to stay the third night ;  but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee . <s> This hotel is way too much money for the services they provide ;  you'd be better off staying in a Motel 6 . <s> We arrived for a weekend stay and really enjoyed the hotel . <s> The cocktail hour was so full of people that we could not get in . <s> The second night we went earlier and it was very nice . <s> The staff was very helpful and had a good knowledge of the area . <s> The rooms were modern and very clean . <s> We will stay there again . <s> This was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the Hyatt Regency Chicago . <s> The first time was far above our expectations for a  $ 69 / per night room . <s> The rooms are very nice ;  and the beds are comfortable . <s> This time we got a great rate through travelzoo @  $ 104 /  night for a room with a view . <s> We were aware of the  $ 41 parking per night . <s> The first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldn't park they were full . <s> We had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages . <s>  ( It was a Saturday evening )  Finally found a spot and were told that it would be  $ 38 . <s> This was 6 blocks from the hotel . <s> Mind you its -6 outside and we have luggage to carry too . <s> Not very good service for a 5-star hotel . <s> We got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby ;  its called the harddrive . <s> That's cool and all ;  yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room ;  it wasn't an issue . <s> The HVAC controls to our room were broken . <s> The first night we were ok ;  but by the second night it was blazing hot in there ;  86 degrees . <s> So hot we couldn't sleep . <s> It was miserable . <s> They sent up the  " engineer "  and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window ;  24 floors up . <s> It never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night . <s> It was 5 below that night and the window being open 8 "  didn't help . <s> They would not put us in another room either . <s> At checkout ;  Monday morning ;  our bill came to  $ 240 . 43 after taxes for the room . <s> We then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for  $ 56 . 65 . <s> Cool ;  I got my reciepts and went on our way . <s> On Wednesday I was on my online banking checking my account ;  to find that Hyatt charged me  $ 289 . 03 and another charge of  $ 103 . 63 !  !  ! <s> That is almost  $ 100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say . <s> I was furious ;  so I called the hotel . <s> Nothing was resolved by my phone call ;  they treated me as if  $ 100 isn't but something you wipe with . <s> She said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off . <s> That didn't settle well with me ;  but what could I do . <s> I waited . <s> Its Friday now . <s> I check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts ;  and they still have  " authorizations "  on the two incorrect amounts as well . <s> They have charged me an additional  $ 300 !  !  !  !  !  ! <s> Im so furious ! <s> and guess what ...  Hyatt doesn't care . <s> They gave me the same [ -- ] line as they did Wednesday . <s> SAVE YOURSELF SOME HASSLE AND DON'T STAY AT THIS HOTEL UNLESS YOU HAVE EXTRA MONEY FOR THEM TO PLAY WITH . <s> I just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - what a treat ! <s> The hotel website offers a great rate ;  and what I found was affordable luxury . <s> I asked for a high floor  &  found myself with a fabulous view ;  in a room where there was an orchid spray in the bathroom ;  terrycloth robes and slippers ;  turndown service ;  Roger Gallet toiletries ;  a fluffy down conforter ;  and a wonderful pillowtop bed . <s> The bathroom was so clean that it sparkled . <s> The service was impeccable as well . <s> Even my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous basket of excellent croissants ;  brioches ;   &  pain au chocolat . <s> The decor was unique  &  the location convenient . <s> Check out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby . <s> This is a topnotch hotel . <s> My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July ;  08 . <s> We had  ( 3 )  1 bedroom suites . <s> Great Location in downtown Chicago . <s> Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions . <s> The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly . <s> The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded . <s> I recommend going early . <s> The rooms were quiet and clean . <s> I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying >2-3 days . <s> We would stay here again . <s> Parking is expensive ;  about  $ 28 / day . <s> It is valet . <s> The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was  $ 24 / days so we did valet parking . <s> The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly . <s> This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites  ( 3 different cities )  . <s> I have had a great experience each time . <s> I'm sitting in the hotel as I right this review and am not impressed with the room . <s> The hotel is not modern in the least - it feels like you're staying in your grandmother's attic . <s> Wallpaper is peeling off the wall ;  not well lit ;  very few outlets in the room  --  especially convenient ones  ( none next to the bed or built into lamps )  ;  terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am . <s> Even the location is off the beaten path - closest L stop is on the Red Line  --  so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring . <s> Health club is not on site either . <s> There are hundreds of other hotels I would stay in over this one . <s> Couldn't have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown Chicago . <s> Hotel Sofitel is right in the heart of the action ;  allowing my friends and I to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown's famous for . <s> The room was comfy ;  with two queen mattresses ;  down stuffed duvets and chic decor . <s> The bar downstairs was a bit pricey ;  but made up for it by being comfortable ;  sleek ;  and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails . <s> One night we didn't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the Cafe des Architectes ;  which had an amazing array of choices ;  mostly of the French persuasion . <s> I would definitely book here again ! <s> I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in Chicago for 3 nights . <s> I must say ;  I was NOT impressed . <s> This is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill . <s> To start with ;  the hotel lobby was totally gaudy . <s> It had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and I guess was supposed to give an air of style . <s> The room was ok I suppose ;  but certainly not worth the premium price I paid for it . <s> The hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing French cuisine ;  but the food ;  while arranged nicely ;  tasted unremarkable and again ;  was overpriced . <s> My final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible . <s> It is simply not worth it . <s> The Swissotel Chicago is a very mediocre hotel ;  the service is always poor ;  and the room service food always comes cold ;  unless it's supposed to be cold than it comes warm . <s> I would rather stay at a super 8 than this place again . <s> This was the best choice my husband and I could have chosen to visit ! <s> The Hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water ! <s> I was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym . <s> Everything was so clean and invoting . <s> Especially The Pump Room ;  there was so much history in one rooom . <s> Overall ;  we had a great ;  relaxing vacation away from the kids . <s> I would definitely return to the Ambassador next time we're in the area ! <s> I booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor . <s> After booking the hotel room I contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds . <s> I was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that I would have a room with 2 double beds . <s> When I arrived I was given a King sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests . <s> Apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed . <s> The staff was completely unaccomodating . <s> To add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in . <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . <s> The customer service is well below what is acceptable . <s> The location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting Chicago . <s> Bottom line is do NOT stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker !  !  ! <s> It has been a couple of years since I stayed here ;  and got it for a night last weekend on Hotwire . <s> I paid only  $ 100 and stayed a Saturday night . <s> I was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel . <s> The lobby has always been great ;  but the rooms were a little shabby in the past . <s> Not any more ;  as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years . <s> The location is still amazing ;  and with the Berghoff open again ;  there is a great restaurant within walking distance . <s> The room itself was fine and comfortable ( very peaceful )  ;  but the customer service by the so-called ;  concierge or  " experience something or the others "  left much to be desired . <s> First ;  I arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk . <s> I was not greeted with the usual  " Hello ;  welcome to ...  "  . <s> Instead ;  I got ;   " Your name ? <s> ID ? <s>  "  No ;   " hello "  ;  no  " welcome to the Amalfi Hotel ;  "  just plain old poor customer service from the very beginning ! <s> That left a very bad taste in my mouth ;  but I decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was . <s> I stayed this hotel for 2 nights . <s> I had high hopes seeing as this is a 4 star hotel and seems quite elegant based on pictures I've seen . <s> Upon entering the building ;  you can easily see that it is clean and high class . <s> The lobby was nice ;  and everything seemed as it should be . <s> However ;  as soon as I made it into my room ;  it was completely different than everything previous to it . <s> It was dirty ;  visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom . <s> The room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms I've been to . <s> There was also a lingering smell from the last tenants . <s> When I called the front desk about these issues ;  they sent someone up to fix it . <s> I left the hotel about two hours and upon returning ;  they were still at it ! <s> This is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors . <s> The smell also did not completely disappear when they were done . <s> As I was too tired ;  I just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at Chicago instead . <s> I hope its shallow exterior does not fool others like it fooled me . <s> Just spent three nights at the Amalfi Hotel ;  while in Chicago on business . <s> Booked a king-corner room and loved it . <s> Largest room I've ever had in a hotel in Chicago ;  incredibly comfortable ;  very clean . <s> The breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too . <s> And the location couldn't be beat . <s> Walking distance to the the River ;  the Loop ;  Michigan Ave shopping and convenient to public transportation . <s> I noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise ;  yes there is some street noise ;  and the building across the street is under construction  ( the noise from that was usually between 730-4 ;  if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side )  but really ;  in downtown Chicago it's not going to be silent ;  if you want silence stay in the suburbs . <s> If you want a great hotel  ( at a great price )  right in the thick of everything ;  stay at the Amalfi . <s> ï»¿Hilton Chicago- We just back from our stay at the Hilton Chicago and I cannot tell you just how much I wish we could have stayed there for another week at very least ! <s> When we walked in the lobby my jaw dropped . <s> I had looked at photos online but the pictures cannot do the high vaulted ceilings and attention to detail that went into this breathtaking entryway . <s> My husband and I  were pleasantly surprised by the short line at check in and the nicest young man upgraded us to a lake view room with an utterly breathtaking  view of lake Michigan . <s> The rest of our stay was a whirlwind of convenient walks to Grant Park ;  the Shedd Aquarium ;  and Millenium park . <s> My husband loved the workout facilities and our spacious room gave us a great home base from which to view Chicago . <s> The staff could not have been nicer . <s> We spent every night in Kitty Oâ€™Sheas ;  the  Irish pub in the hotel . <s> I have to recommend the corned beef which is by far the tastiest I have ever encountered . <s> Overall an incredible trip !  ! <s> One that we will always remember . <s> Thanks Hilton ! <s> To start with ;  this hotel had the worst customer service . <s> They were impossible to work with on EVERYTHING ! <s> Now ;  the problems we had in chronological order . <s> First ;  we arrive at 8 PM Sat . <s> to check in . <s> They did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available ;  so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway  ( free of charge )  . <s> However ;  the room was not ready yet . <s> Finally at 10 . 30 ! <s>  ( 2 . 5 hrs later )  we were able to get our room keys . <s> But ;  there was no rollaway . <s> Another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later ;  we had a rollaway ;  but had to get the charge waived a second time . <s> Now we go to check out on Mon . <s> and they couldn't print us a bill or give us a total . <s> We stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn  $ 2 ; 127 . 00 ! <s> We called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 TIMES ;  for  $ 709 each ;  when our bill was supposed to be  $ 450 . <s> After sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1 . 5hrs ;  the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home . <s> I would recommend a Holiday Inn over the Intercontinental any day . <s> This is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro . <s> The previous times ;  I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro . <s> But my reaction has soured on this place . <s> We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping . <s> From the very start ;  this year was a disappointment . <s> I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro . <s> I was quoted one price  ( higher than what was on line )  ;  when I mentioned this ;  I was told I could have the lower price . <s> At check in ;  the desk was nice but not friendly . <s> We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past  ( punishment for asking for a lower price ? <s>  )  The closet had no hangers ;  we had no place to put our suitcase . <s> No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening . <s> On the second day ;  we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing . <s> It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one . <s> I wrote the management following our stay . <s> I have yet to receive a reply . <s> Needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time . <s> I would advise others to do the same . <s> I recently had my wedding at the Omni Hotel in Chicago and I was more than pleased . <s> The decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one ;  I was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once I met with the staff at the Omni I was certain that it was the way to go . <s> The staff was so attentive and friendly ;  and I felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel . <s> I highly recommend the Omni Hotel in Chicago ;  brides will not be dissapointed ! <s> I recently had the misfortune of staying at the Swissotel Chicago hotel in Illinois ;  and it was one of the worse travel experiences I have ever had ! <s> First off the shuttle that was suppose to pick us up at the air port was late by over an hour ! <s> Then when the bus finally came ;  the driver was nice enough but it was clearly his first day on the job since he got lost going back to the hotel . <s> Finally when we got to the hotel they didn ; t seem to have our reservation for the 2nd room . <s>  ( my wife and I stay in one room ;  our teenage girls usually stay in their own room . <s>  )  So after the very rude clerk at the corner did nothing to help us we were forced to pack into one room . <s> we would have rented another room but they had no vacancies left . <s> They hotel did have a large occupancy rate ;  but that only slowed up everything else . <s> our room service was late almost everytime we ordered ;  and the hotel restaurant never had a wait less then 45 mins . <s> The quality of the room was fair enough ;  but it was almost impossible to get room service ;  we could not get fresh towels for almost 2 days ! <s> We were suppose to stay for a week ;  we left after 4 days and found a different hotel to stay at . <s> I would not recommend this place to anyone ! <s> stay away ! <s> I'd been searching for a cool ;  non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend . <s> I thought I'd found a winner in the Affinia ...  SOO disappointed !  ! <s> In spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults ;  we arrived to find our room had a DOUBLE bed . <s> What ?  ! <s> I was floored ;  but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride ;  was too tired to make a fuss . <s> We were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night ;  so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple . <s> I was told that room service would call ME back to take my order ... and nothing happened . <s> I didn't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs . <s> Nothing special ;  entree ;  dessert and NAB for two still came out to  $ * ... I am no hayseed ;  I'm WELL aware that everything costs more in Chicago ;  but this just wasn't worth it . <s> Our room was by the elevator w /  parking garage view ... the bathroom was tiny ;  shower curtain was stained ;  funky toilet seat / lid ;  and the vanity featured that  " rude awakening "  lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms ;  i . e . <s>  ;   " Holy crap ;  have I looked that bad this whole time ?  ! <s>  "  If you're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker ;  they charge for their chintzy coffees  ( I don't use these ;  but ...  come on )  . <s> Nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar ;  but weak drinks ...  That night ;  our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that I almost asked to switch rooms . <s> But the Marathon was that weekend ;  the hotel was so busy I didn't want to be a pest . <s> I can't believe I was so impressed with this place online . <s> Next time I'll happily pay more to stay someplace that's actually a treat . <s> We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago . <s> It was elegant ;  classy ;  and the service was impeccable . <s> It was very family friendly for us ;  with the spacious rooms ;  the kid's room ;  and the no smoking policy . <s> We were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see . <s> The food was delicious and we didn't have to go outside the hotel to find good food . <s> When visiting Chicago again ;  we will come back . <s> It was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price . <s> Linda Davies <s> The Sheraton is a fantastic hotel . <s> My wife and I stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the Chicago River and Lake Michigan . <s> The view was great . <s> We got a corner room that also had a couch in . <s> The hotel was just a short walk to the Navy Pier and the Magnificant Mile Shopping area . <s> Food at the hotel was great . <s> Service from checking in to maid service was first class . <s> Great Hotel ;  Great Town ;  Highly recommend it . <s> My wife and I just spent 3 nights at The Talbott . <s> The room was spacious ;  comfortable and well-appointed . <s> The hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby . <s> Linens and towels first-class . <s> Free Wi-Fi in the room . <s> The location is terrific ;  just one block to Michigan Avenue . <s> We will stay here on future visits . <s> I would not stay at this hotel again . <s> The rooms had a fowl odor . <s> It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned . <s> The neighborhood was also less than desirable . <s> The housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms . <s> I will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted . <s> Hi ;  I had very bad experience with this hotel ;  as the rooms had bad smell and very dim light . <s> the bed sheets were not properly cleaned . <s> Also the carpet was dirty though AC was working properly . <s> But i would nor recommend this hotel to my friends as it did not satisfied me . <s> There was a problem with hot and cold water in the bathroom . <s> Please do not go to this hotel ;  it seems very nice from the pictures and all but in actual its different . <s> My husband and I had a wonderful stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . <s> I had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite . <s> When we arrived ;  she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what I had requested -- and more . <s> Our suite had a partial view of the lake !  !  ! <s> And ;  we were able to check in early . <s> The service at this hotel is incredible . <s> Everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had . <s> The suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel ;  very near to Michigan Avenue . <s> Housekeeping was prompt and thorough . <s> We really couldn't have asked for a better hotel . <s> We will definitely stay there on future trips to Chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there . <s> I recently stayed at the Sofitel Hotel  ( Chicago Water Tower )  ;  and I was quite disappointed . <s> I was excited by the great location  ( on East Chestnut Street downtown )  ;  but this was a mediocre hotel for the price  (  $ 250 per night before taxes )  . <s> The view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters ;  and yes ;  the view of downtown in the distance was pretty ;  but I was very disappointed . <s> The bedding seemed to be polyester ;  not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately . <s> When I ordered room service at 10 : 30  ( on a Thursday night )  ;  I had to wait for 55 minutes ;  20 minutes longer than I was quoted . <s> I ordered a salad ;  and I thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long . <s> Overall ;  I was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower . <s> I enjoyed a pleasant 2 night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago ;  Il . <s> The hotel was beautiful ;  inside and out . <s> I felt as if I was a celebrity staying there . <s> The staff was especially kind and very professional . <s> My husband and I have never felt more comfortable . <s> I was very pleased that they had transportation for us ;  since we flew in to Chicago for our anniversary . <s> The Shedd Aquarium package was an excellent bonus . <s> I highly recommend this hotel to everyone that's going to be visiting Chicago ! <s> My wife and I stayed here and had a terrible experience . <s> After messing up our reservations ;  the staff decided to blame us for the mistake . <s> The manager was extremely rude and highly incompetent ;  and assigned us to a one-bedroom room after claiming that no more two-bedroom rooms were available . <s> Stay away from this hotel unless you want to have a terrible experience . <s> I got married in the Chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel . <s> They had nothing but nice things to say about it ! <s> My husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs . <s> The rooms are decorated so nicely and they don't have that funny hotel smell . <s> The Pump Room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports . <s> If I'm ever in the area again I will be sure to book a room at the Ambassador East Hotel ! <s> I selected the Talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online . <s> We have had wonderful experiences with boutiques  ( Monaco ;  Allegro )  and assumed this would be comparable . <s> Good points :  the lobby is beautiful ;  and one staff member took roses I bought for my wife and arranged them nicely . <s> The many problems :  When my wife called with a question on our arrival day ;  the agent could find no reservation  --  15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly . <s> When we arrived ;  the lobby was stuffed with students ;  nobody tried to manage the group ;  several of whom pushed ahead to the check-in desk . <s> We left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle . <s> We finally were checked in ;  after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms . <s> When we got there ;  our room had not been made up from the last guest . <s> When we complained ;  we were given an  " upgrade "  to a room that was old and uninspired . <s> Chairs are scuffed ;  closet shelves are bowed ;  the air conditioner is noisy ;  and a wall lamp is loose . <s> The view is of a construction site . <s> Movies-on-demand are dated . <s> We expect this from a budget hotel ;  not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale . <s> When we returned after an evening out ;  the card reader to open the main doors did not work . <s> One staff member admonished us  ( really )  for not using the reader ;  when in fact we had tried . <s> This was embarrassing ;  as others were standing in the lobby . <s> I tried to access the hotel's wifi network ;  but was only given a  $ 9 . 95 upgrade option . <s> I called the desk ;  and was told to  " click past it "  ;  which of course did nothing . <s> It wasn't until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked . <s> We are pretty easygoing ;  we love good treatment and tip handsomely . <s> If we had only 1or 2 problems ;  we wouldn't write . <s> In fact ;  we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right . <s> The president wrote a letter ;  and suggested others at the hotel would be in touch ... nobody ever was . <s> I will never stay here again . <s> I was lured in by the hotel's pictures showing a fabulous suite . <s> Instead I arrived to find cheap furniture that smelled of old cheese . <s> I called the front desk to see if there was another room available . <s> I was put on hold for five minutes and no one came back on the line . <s> I ended up going to the front desk myself . <s> I was ignored and not given assistance until I interrupted the front desk clerk who seemed to be on a personal call . <s> The clerk apologize but then looked at me with an attitude when I requested another room because mine smelled like old cheese . <s> I was informed that there were no other rooms available but that they would send up housekeeping . <s> Housekeeping sprayed some Febreeze on the couch and then left . <s> I tried to relax by turning on the TV in the bedroom . <s> I sat on the bed and saw something scurry under the pillow . <s> I checked the corner of the mattress and found bedbugs . <s> I packed up my bags and left after that . <s> I did get a refund on the room after some complaining . <s> I went across town to the Marriott where I had a much better stay . <s> Nestled just off the beaten path and about two blocks from the river the Fairmont Chicago offers an excellent location to operate as home base for your trip to Chicago . <s> The staff were friendly and helpful ;  arranging many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city . <s> There are many attractions withiin easy walking distance  ( The Art Institute is a must see and Millenium Park is a fun visit )  . <s> The architectural tour by river departs a dock that is very close to the Fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby . <s> The rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense . <s> We would definitely stay here again . <s> Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown is a wonderful hotel . <s> The hotel is very elegant ;  classy and only offers the best . <s> The hotel offers complimentary breakfast ;  along with delicious meals and wines in the afternoons . <s> The suites are very real designed and has a very upscale look . <s> This wonderfully cozy yet graceful hotel leaves you with an experience of a lifeltime . <s> I would recommend this awesome hotel to anyone that was looking for beautiful ;  yet comfortable hotel experience . <s> Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco . <s> We have stayed many times elsewhere ;  primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service ;  beverages like water or soda at the wine bar ;  coffee and papers in the morning ;  help with bags . <s> Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things ;  the staff was not helpful ;  either . <s> Requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there . <s> YOu got the feeling you were  " bothering "  people if you asked a question . <s> No bellman ;  the doorman did not open the door or help with bags . <s> Even though we were traveling with a child ;  I had to request a fish when they did not bring it . <s> Really baffling ..  as we love the Monoco in Washington . <s> My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend of Sept .  17-18 ;  2011 . <s> When we were planning our vacation ;  we were impressed with the hotel . <s> The exterior is very lovely and we looked forward to enjoying the view from our room . <s> We first started to wonder if we'd made the right choice when there was no one waiting to help us with our bags . <s> We had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change . <s> This seems like something a supposedly  " world class "  hotel should be able to avoid . <s> The good :  Our room did have a nice view and when I sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud . <s> The shower was very pleasant . <s> The bad :  The room was very small and the bed was not the King size we had requested . <s> We felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay . <s> We have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed . <s> The restaurant options were acceptable ;  although the service was not as excellent as described . <s> Perhaps we expected a miracle that would've changed our minds about the hotel . <s> We were so disappointed by the room and the service at check-in the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted . <s> We usually enjoy partaking of room service ;  but we decided after a sub par first day we would eat out for the rest of the weekend . <s> Next time ;  we will look into other hotels in the Chicago area . <s> Recently stayed at the InterContinental Chicago Magnificent Mile and was a little underwhelmed . <s> It's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating . <s> There is a definite need for some noise control  --  everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room . <s> Hearing the plumbing from other guests' rooms was particularly annoying . <s> The fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use  ( at least it wasn't included with my booking choice )  . <s> Parking was pretty expensive so if you really don't need it ;  don't use it . <s> Overall ;  just dissappointed that the great location wasn't matched with great accommodations . <s> I arrived to find that my room was not ready ;  despite it being past the 3pm check in time . <s> I was not offered any compensation for this ;  or any real apology ;  just shunted off to the side to wait it out . <s> This took a good hour and a half ;  during which time I was needing to be reading for a meeting . <s> Again ;  no apologies ;  just my card . <s> The room was adequately clean  ( it had better be ...  )  though sparsely furnished for the price . <s> It did not feel very welcoming and the decoration was reminiscent of bad nights spent in hot ;  south coastal motels . <s> I encountered several problems with on site amenities ;  both in room and out . <s> Some staff tried to be helpful on occasion but were rarely able to make headway ;  even when I complained on the third night about rowdy neighbors . <s> It seemed as if where there was not apathy or cluelessness there was barely concealed surliness . <s> After the abysmal  ( lack of )  service at the hotel bar I elected to eat out every other night  ( I declined to try the room service ;  unimpressed with every other offering so far )  . <s> I would not use this hotel for my business or personal trips . <s> The Homewood Suites by Hilton ;  in downtown Chicago ;  has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city . <s> After asking the doorman ;  I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen . <s> The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take ;  as did the stove and LCD televisions . <s> This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago . <s> It's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as  $ 40 a night ;  which is what I payed when I stayed there in September . <s> The atmosphere was warm and cozy ;  and the staff were all very friendly and professional . <s> On a recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millemmium Park Hotel I was appalled at the service I received at such a supposedly high end hotel . <s> When I arrived I had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in . <s> Apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with . <s> Finally I was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area . <s> Much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and I heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight . <s> And the room was obviously a room for smokers . <s> The blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke . <s> I ;  of course complained ;  but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but I was welcome to check out and go to another hotel . <s> After a fitfull night's sleep I awoke to children running up and down the hallway . <s> Their parents were no where in sight . <s> My shower was cold and had no pressure . <s> I was given two towels one of which had not been laundered . <s> I could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him I would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it . <s> I cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark . <s> Allegro Chicago - I stayed in this hotel when I had to visit Chicago for a business meeting . <s> I would say that the hotel can be barely classified as a 'hotel' . <s> It was more of a building with some lousy attempt to make it look good . <s> The rooms are pretty small and the hotel staff is not at all helping . <s> The valet parking is expensive . <s> Being right in the middle of the city makes the place noisy and also it is surrounded by tall buildings which spoil the view from the hotel . <s> It is not the worst place but there are better places to stay in Chicago for same money . <s> We stayed here from Nov .  30 to Dec 2 and had a wonderful time . <s> The hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from check in to the maid staff to the bartenders in Kitty O'Shea's . <s> We had a room with a king bed that was very comfortable and had very nice feather pillows . <s> You can request other types if you have a problem with feathers . <s> The large flat screen TV was very nice . <s> Bath products were by Crabtree  &  Evelyn and included shampoo ;  conditioner ;  mouthwash and bady lotion . <s> Plenty of coffee was provided . <s> We drank and had snacks at Kitty O'Shea's . <s> The crowd was fun and there was live Irish folk music each night . <s> Good selection of beer and good Shepards Pie ;  Cheese Dip and Crisps ! <s> The location worked very well for us . <s> We walked to the Art Museum and Buddy Guys Blues Club is right across the street . <s> And shopping was a breeze using the shuttle ! <s> The cab ride to the Museum of Science and Industry was quite far though and cost about  $ 15 each way . <s> An excellent weekend getaway ! <s> I haven't stayed all that much with Hyatt and I'm not sure if I will be going back anytime soon . <s> The staff was very professional and helpful . <s> Our room was close to being 4 stars ;  however ;  fell a little short . <s> It really is time for a remodel of the bathroom . <s> The toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush . <s> I'm not a germ freak or anything ;  however ;  I really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if I don't have to . <s> The hotel was fully booked with a teen convention  ( FCCLA )  and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it . <s> The noise at night from every direction . <s> The only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party . <s> Coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic . <s> With little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another ;  absolutely ridiculous . <s> The lobby of the Hyatt at night was a complete Zoo . <s> During our second night I finally had enough and called to complain only to be told the Hotel was fully aware of the situation and that there really wasn't anything they could do . <s>  ... read more <s> The Sofitel Chicago Water Tower was horrible . <s> The first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was OK to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didn't even have a record of our reservation . <s> After much inappropriate arguing ;  they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine . <s> When we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or TV . <s> It took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably . <s> The next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in . <s> A quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount . <s> We finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel ;  the FancyPants Hotel and Suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club . <s> Overall ;  the service at the Sofitel was rude ;  rooms were unsatisfactory ;  restaurant sub-par ;  not well kept up or clean . <s> In the future I would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record ;  like the FancyPants Hotel and suits ;  my personal favorite . <s> Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel . <s> Good location but the room was dirty ;  and not just from the last housekeeping . <s> It was dingy :  a place where you needed the slippers they provided . <s> And this was a suite . <s> Also ;  the refrigerator was caked with ice and didn't work . <s> Furthermore ;  because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel ;  I showed up a day late . <s> The hotel said it wasn't a problem and that I wouldn't be charged for the no-show the night before . <s> I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day . <s> Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve . <s> Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again . <s> Two dots only because it's in a good location and because the lobby was clean . <s> I'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad . <s> I recently visited Chicago . <s> I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago . <s> First of all I did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel . <s> My hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast . <s> The food served was not up to par I felt like it was a cheap  " free "  lunch . <s> My room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them . <s> My toilet paper row was half way finished when I checked in . <s> I felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room . <s> I did not feel safe ;  I had to hide my valuables and I kept the  " BUSY "  sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff . <s> The rooms did not appear as they do on their website ;  it is actually the opposite . <s> Looked to me like a regular motel inn but I paid way more than I would have at an actual motel inn . <s> I did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip . <s> I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone . <s> I was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel ;  after hearing all the good things about it . <s> Unfortunately ;  it was a very underwhelming experience ;  to say the least . <s> But let me begin with the things that I do like about the hotel . <s> First off ;  it is located my favorite part of Chicago - the leafy ;  affluent part of town that is Chicago's equivalent of Manhattan's Upper East Side ;  complete with sidewalks ;  quiet tree-lined streets ;  real old-school townhouses  ( instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums )  ;  cute boutiques  ( instead of Gap ;  Banana Republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands )  and ;  of course ;  Hermes of Paris  ( which warrants a separate mention )  . <s> I also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches ;  cherry colored wooden furnitures ;  area rugs and distinct artwork . <s> The very reason why I always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains . <s> I definitely love the room . <s> While the space issue is not as bad in Chicago as it is in Manhattan ;  getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task . <s> So we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous ;  ample bathroom ;  double sink ;  massive king bed AND still enough space to walk around ;  do a chicken dance ;  and strut my Herve and Louboutins in . <s> My only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room ;  but then again Delaware St is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us ;  so can't have it all ! <s> Yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service ;  or lack thereof . <s> I mean ;  seriously . <s> They don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason . <s> I did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so I do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that I would be getting from say ;  a 3000-room Vegas hotel . <s> First ;  I called in to reconfirm my reservation . <s> The lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent . <s> First off ;  she was not able to find my reservation and I was transferred to the front desk staff ;  to whom I had to explain myself all over again  ( my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service )  . <s> The person who manned the reception desk was not friendly ;  nor was he at all competent either . <s> Case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which I agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in ;  which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there . <s> But the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1AM . <s> As a general rule ;  I am never ;  ever ;  a big fan of room service ;  having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18 %  gratuity ;  10 . 5 %  tax  ( and still expect a tip )  on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account . <s> Think overcooked steaks ;  lukewarm soup ;  bread hard enough to knock someone out ;  and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite . <s> So I really wasn't expecting hotels as small as Talbott to have a 24-hour room service ;  but lo and behold ;  they do . <s> I placed an order of chicken BLT ;  which  ( to my initial delight )  came in within 20 minutes . <s> Then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of  $ 2 on top of the 18 %  service fee  ( refer above )  I opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin ;  microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of Lay's chips  ( lightly salted flavor )  . <s> The bread looked like someone stomped on it ;  the L and T looked like it was 2 days old ;  the B was unrecognizable ;  and the chicken was burnt and cold . <s> It was pathetic room service at its finest . <s> We did get the item taken off our bill  ( rightfully so too )  but the front desk person was ;  instead of apologetic ;  defiant . <s> The whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving ;  it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself . <s> We won't be coming back ;  unfortunately . <s> I was completely unfamiliar with Chicago but needed a place to stay while my husband worked there for a few days and we picked the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based solely on their internet site . <s> Wow did I get lucky ! <s> This is a beautiful hotel with all of amenities I could have hoped for ;  terrific food ;  and within walking distance of several interesting places ;  including the Art Institute of Chicago . <s> Ashley ;  at the concierge desk ;  was particularly helpful at guiding a Chicago newbie to the best places to eat ands to see . <s> I will heartily recommend the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . <s> I had to go down to Chicago one weekend for the graduation ceremony of my cousin . <s> It was a sudden trip and I didn't even have the time to book a hotel before hand . <s> When I showed up in Chicago and asked my taxi driver to take me to the nearest good hotel ;  he took me to Omni Chicago Hotel . <s> I was impressed with how clean it was and they didn't have a problem with getting me a room even though I didn't have a reservation . <s> The staff was friendly to me the entire time I was in the hotel ;  which was just a short two nights ;  and the cleaning service was top notch . <s> The Amalfi Hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when I visit Chicago . <s> This place really knows how to treat their guests . <s> They serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have iPod docking stations in the room ! <s> If you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection . <s> I took advantage of the free wi-fi AND the plush bathrobes . <s> While I stayed there I had to try the spa services that were offered . <s> Wonderful experience ! <s> The staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and I will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to Chicago . <s> The Hard Rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway . <s> The rooms are quiet ;  the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size . <s> We had fabulous service and got a great rate . <s> Other than the fact that there were no bathrobes  ( it's listed as an amenity )  and the Sony radio didn't work ;  it was perfect . <s> Would definitely stay there again ! <s> I chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed . <s> The previous weekend ;  I stayed at a 2 . 5 star hotel a few blocks away ;  and was much more impressed there . <s> The Hard Rock had a number of issues including :  very dark room - not much light  ( artificial or natural )  ;  lots of street noise ;  very cheap decor and furniture ;  broken cabinet door ;  very warm room - said they would send maintenance ;  but they never arrived ;  had bar charges on account that were not ours . <s> Overall ;  I was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel . <s> I expected a much better experience ! <s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower - We had a great stay at Sofitel during our family trip to Chicago . <s> The location was simply great . <s> Located in downtown Chicago ;  it was very convenient to shops ;  restaurants ;  and subway stations . <s> The rooms were a good size and very clean . <s> Although it was kind of on the pricey side ;  for the location and the comfortable stay ;  we really couldn't complain . <s> I would be happy to return next time I'm in Chicago ! <s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park - Here's what you don't want to hear when you walk into a Fairmont hotel at 11 : 00pm after a 10-hour flight :   " I'm sorry ;  Ma'am ;  the hotel is overbooked . <s> The only rooms we still have available are in the smoking section . <s>  "  Because apparently what a confirmed reservation and  $ 300 / night will get you is blank stares and an  " I'm sorry ;  Ma'am ;  that's the best we can do at the moment .  "  . <s> So I took the room because I was so tired that all I wanted was to sink into a bed and deal with this in the morning . <s> Well ;  I should have just gone to a different hotel because not only did the whole floor ;  including my room ;  reek so bad that I got an immediate headache ;  but the room itself was so dingy that I cannot understand how they manage to keep their prices up . <s> The carpet looked so old and gross that I decided to keep my shoes on just to be safe . <s> The furnishings look like they came out of my grandma's attic . <s> The layout is so weird that every time you go to the bathroom you have to be careful not to walk right into a table corner . <s> The bathroom is small and cramped ;  with a perfectly placed mirror to let you stare at yourself while sitting on the toilet . <s> The tap was perfect for having water splashed all over yourself while you're brushing your teeth . <s> Great for when you want to take a shower ;  because the shower itself WAS NOT WORKING ! <s> Huh ;  you'd think this is something SOMEONE would have taken note of ;  especially the cleaning staff if they really DID clean the shower after the previous customer ;  which I now suspect they hadn't . <s> I called downstairs and a surly concierge condescended to give me a room where at least the shower worked  ( though still in the smoking section ;  of course )  . <s> By the time I finally managed to fall asleep it was 4am and the cleaning staff promptly knocked on my door at 8am and waltzed right in ! <s> I was so taken aback with the lack of professionalism  ( and common sense ! <s>  )  of the staff ;  the irresponsible overbooking from the management ;  and the state of the rooms themselves that I will not be stopping here again . <s> Not worth the price . <s> We almost stayed at a hotel for  $ 110 a night ;  but instead choose the Hard Rock for  $ 180  ( a special )  . <s> We were located on the  " newly renovated "  Beatles floor . <s> The carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced . <s> Upon entering our room we found some cool Beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot Marilyn Manson portrait . <s> I think they were halfway done re theming the room . <s> At checkout they tried to charge us  $ 11 for using the mini-bar which we didn't even open . <s> They removed the charge right away but I wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge . <s> Nothing special here . <s> If you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you . <s> My wife and I just spent the Labor Day weekend in the city ;  choosing the Hard Rock Hotel as our pad . <s> We've stayed at the HRH in Orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there . <s> It's not that way here . <s> These may be all ticky tacky things ;  but they added up to us . <s> First of all ;  the room . <s> We upgraded our reservation thru the HRH website for a room with  " an Incredible view "  . <s> Well ;  our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us . <s> That was all we could see . <s> So there was no view . <s> The room was muggy . <s> We had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74 . <s> We woke up sweaty both days . <s> When we opened the window to get a breeze ;  the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing . <s> The room was small and dark ;  but it didn't bother us that much . <s> The bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed I ever slept in . <s> And we even joked about stealing the pillows ! <s> We had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster ;  but they removed the charges no prob . <s> Throughout the entire hotel ;  I counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia . <s> I thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel ;  throw a Styx guitar on the wall ;  and slap a HRH emblem on the outside . <s> The hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation . <s> The location is good ;  right on the south end of the mag mile ;  but there are 10-15 better hotels in a better location to shopping ;  quality eats ;  and Navy Pier . <s> If you have a car ;  parking will cost you  $ 38 / day ;  which is prob normal for downtown . <s> The hotel restaurant was a Chinese restaurant . <s> The bar was small and trendy ;  and I guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a Pina Colada and they told us they didn't have a blender . <s> WHAAT ?  ?  ?  ? <s> A HRH without a blender ? <s> Did they not know that Jimmy Buffet was in town ?  ?  ?  ? <s> Mind blowing ! <s> I would never ;  never ;  never go back here . <s> Like I said ;  there are many better hotels in much better locations . <s> I will stay at the HRH in Orlando or elsewhere again . <s> How about this had reservation confirmation in hand and still had to argue with the registration desk about price on reservation . <s> She tried to charge me price on bill they slide under your door . <s> Sorry not on my watch ! <s> Then about this room you gave me I understand this place is old but for the price you charge how about some indoor plumbing ! <s> You take a shower and the tub fills with water will not drain this is absolutely redickulas for this being a Hilton I think you should step back and take a look at how this place is operating . <s> Registration :  Fail Parking price :  Fail Plumbing :  Fail Thank you Hilton for for my super 8 experience in Chicago . <s> Here are some pros and cons :  Pros :  -Good location -Nice staff -Clean room Cons :  -Lack of bathroom amenities  ( I get better items at a Holiday Inn )  -Housekeeping wasn't so great ...  1 . <s> A bathroom rug was taken out of my room  ( no idea why )  and never returned it . <s> The marble floor in the bathroom was very dangerous when slippery ... I had to throw towels on the ground to make sure I did not fall . <s> 2 . <s> I was charged for items I did not take out of the minibar . <s> We booked through a travel website . <s> This hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in September . <s> The public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done . <s> The hallway was so dimly lit ;  we couldn't see how to use the key card . <s> The shock came when we entered the room . <s> Whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest's comfort into consideration . <s> The bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress  ( rock hard )  over a platform . <s> The  " nigh stands "  were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height . <s> The room was stark - all off-white ;  no color . <s> No art work or any decoration at all . <s> The full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit ;  if it were winter and the heat was on ;  I think this could be dangerous . <s> There was a desk  &  chair but no clock / radio in the room ;  there was a wall mounted LCD tv with very poor channel selection . <s> The bathroom was very small but clean . <s> The problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to . <s> An older person could have never stayed in the room . <s> Because of the renovation ;  there was no restaurant on-site . <s> No vending or ice available on the floor either I can't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel . <s> I would never stay there again . <s> Oh My ! <s> More Like A Dank Museum Than A Four Star Hotel ! <s> I read so many reviews on this hotel that I was sure my husband and I wouldn't be disappointed on spending our 10th Wedding Anniversary in the heart of Chicago at such a luxurious hotel ! <s> All the reviews sounded great so I feel awkward writing this ;  but I have to be fair - this place was a major disappointment . <s> While the location is superb ;  the images online must have been taken over 10 years ago because all of the decor when we visited looked very old and faded . <s> I noticed dirt everywhere - the fabric on the furniture was stained ;  the baseboards and woodwork were scratched and dirty and there seemed to be a smell of mold and mildew that permeated the entire hotel . <s> Even though the food was great ;  the linens ;  glassware and silverware were not sparkling - it sort of helped that candles were lit so I didn't focus too much on how dreary and washed out the dining facility was . <s> I didn't realize experiencing history would actually mean staying at a hotel that's living in the past ! <s> This was barely a two star hotel and I do not recommend staying here at all . <s> I stayed at the Monaco-Chicago back in April . <s> I was in town on business ;  and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine . <s> Having spent a weekend there ;  I have no idea what my friend was talking about . <s> The complimentary morning coffee was weak ;  the fitness room was dimly lit ;  and I thought I'd have to have my clothes mailed back to me when I used their supposed  " overnight "  laundry service for a suit I spilled some wine on . <s> My room was adequate ;  but nowhere near what I've seen elsewhere at this price point . <s> Recent renovation must be slang for  " everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive . <s>  "  The mattress in my room was incredibly firm ;  and I slept poorly . <s> When I travel ;  I expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home . <s> At most hotels ;  I receive excellent service and comfortable accomodations . <s> This was an exception to my usual ;  and I won't be back anytime soon . <s> I recently made a business trip to Chicago ;  in which I stayed at the downtown Fairmont hotel . <s> During my visit ;  I had an aroma-harmony massage . <s> This experience greatly relieved my stress ;  from all the business meetings I'd had that day . <s> Candace worked wonders for my neck muscles ;  especially . <s> This was the only amenity that I sought out ;  during my trip . <s> My time was very limited . <s> However ;  the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if I were a valued guest . <s> I'll definately stay at this hotel again when I'm in the area . <s> And ;  I highly recommend the spa ! <s> Two main issues :   ( 1 )  understaffed from the street to the front desk . <s> Unfortunately I had to drive into the city ;  when I arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking . <s> Then inside ;  there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel . <s> Not good  ( I will say friendly however )   ( 2 )  I know this is a big city ;  but ;   $ 49 a night to park my car when I'm staying at that hotel ? <s> Really ?  ? <s> That's unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion . <s> Again ;  I realize this is Chicago ;  but ;  I'm already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel . <s> Intercontinental Chicago - I admit that I was a little hesitant about booking at Intercontinental Chicago in the first place after reading some bad reviews but that’s what makes me share my good experience . <s> I found this place quite comfortable and reasonable as far as price is concerned . <s> I mean you have the view of beautiful Michigan Avenue from your window ;  the rooms are recently renovated ;  spacious and clean ;  the room service is prompt and the best part is the huge pool which my kids loved !  ! <s> I would definitely stay here the next time I visit Chicago . <s> While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before ;  this was my husband's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time . <s> Well the second stay was even better  --  we had one of the corner suites on the river  --  the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful . <s> The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing . <s> Unfortunately we missed the wine hour . <s> One thing that realy impressed me is that b / c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late  --  Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation . <s> This hotel is trading on the Hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and depressing . <s> Although classed as a three star the prices do not reflect this . <s> It was more expensive than other four star hotels in the neighbourhood ;  The breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded . <s> All in all the worst hotel we stayed at in a 14 day tour of Canada and the USA . <s> Would not stay there again . <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting accommodation in Chicago . <s> Ideal position ;  lovely quiet rooms ;  good facilities ;  complimentary breakfast well received and the Manager's evening drinks reception excellent ;  we always tipped the staff who were serving our drinks . <s> The in-house Amalfitini cocktail was very good . <s> The staff were very friendly and helpful . <s> If I ever return to Chicago I would certainly stay there again . <s> Theres nothing bad I can say about this hotel . <s> I called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of December 2012 for a rate with a local corporation . <s> When I first made the reservation I did not get an e-mail confirmation . <s> I had to call again to get the e-mail and then saw that I was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me ;  my wife and three year old . <s> I called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate I was at ;  however for ten dollars more I can upgrade to a regular room . <s> I then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me . <s> i told them to cancel the room . <s> based on the reservation experience ;  I did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel . <s> We ate at the Prime House restaurant last year ;  that is why we picked the hotel . <s> Last year the food and service at the Prime House was outstanding . <s> This year the service felt rushed . <s> The waitress even asked why we were eating so early . <s> It was 6 : 30pm . <s> Our room in the hotel felt cramped . <s> The beds were comfortable . <s> The bathroom had maintenance problems . <s> The maid service and turndown out night was good . <s> All of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful . <s> I just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying . <s> We've just returned from a two night stay at the Affinia Chicago and our visit was delightful . <s> Thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance .. it was a mess . <s> And the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable . <s> Even parts of the lobby had  " wet paint "  stickers . <s> All these things could have made for a disappointing stay . <s> Not so !  ! <s> Although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff . <s> After just a few minutes we felt like we were  " at home . <s>  "  The suite on the 25th floor ;  with a fab view along a wall of windows ;  was sparkling fresh and clean . <s> The bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger ... she was right ! <s> Everything in and about the room was  " like-new "  and very stylish . <s> As a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the Magnificient Mile and all of its ambiance . <s> Thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff ;  a fantastic location ;  and chic decorating elements ;  this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in Chicago . <s> The stay was short .. but sweet . <s> The James Chicago-This hotel is pretty bad and expensive . <s> I stayed in one of their guest rooms and it was too small to accommodate even one person comfortably . <s> The bed and floors were dirty ;  and the shower leaked water everywhere because of a broken pipe . <s> I would not stay at the James again ;  especially not at the price . <s> Oh my goodness ;  this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown Chicago . <s> It all went well enough checking in ;  but them went downhill . <s> There was so much left to be desired . <s> The biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet ;  I kid you not ! <s> I guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it ;  I just don't know . <s> But for the prices they charge ;  this type of thing is unacceptable . <s> Most everything else about the actual room was as expected . <s> The noise was a bit more than I'm used to though ;  but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us . <s> So we asked to be moved to another room ;  they did get us in another room ;  but that took nearly 2 hours . <s> The second room worked out well for us ;  but I won't be risking staying here again . <s> Plus the pool was not available ;  I really wish they would have mentioned that on their website ;  I was looking forward to it for days . <s> All in all ;  it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location ;  but they need to work on their customer service before I'll reconsider staying at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown . <s> My family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early August . <s> We were promised a room with two double beds . <s> When we arrived  ( earlier than most )  we were told they were 45 double beds short . <s> We reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed . <s> We had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away . <s> Little did we know we were being CHARGED a daily fee for this bed . <s> The managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel . <s> The bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night . <s> The managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating . <s> We were so disappointed in this hotel . <s> Also ;  they do not have a pool here . <s> If you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay  $ 20 a day to use it . <s>  $ 80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous . <s> Do yourself a favor ;  if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise ;  go elsewhere . <s> Chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one . <s> I never heard back from managment on this issue when I called and emailed so obviously they don't care ;  even when I told them I'd write a review on this website . <s> Chicago is an awesome city though . <s> We loved it ! <s> First of all ;  Expedia . com charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when I arrived at the Hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered . <s> The Hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk . <s> I had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word !  ! <s> I was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the Hotel . <s> When we went to leave the gate would not open . <s> We had to find the parking garage office and the Manager had to call several times over to the Hotel until finally someone picked up . <s> They confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure . <s> The Hotel itself is beautiful !  !  ! <s> The bell hops and doormen were just wonderful . <s> They were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all !  !  !  ! <s> I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago while on a business trip . <s> I have to say that I was very displeased with the service i received during my stay . <s> Even though their website boasts that their staff will be at your beck and call ;  i found them to be very rude . <s> The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the noise level very high . <s> I was awakened by guests in the next room several times . <s> Even though I complained to the front desk ;  they did not resolve the issue . <s> I definitely would not recommend this hotel and I will be staying at a different hotel if I am in the area again . <s> My wife and I spent several nights here on a getaway excursion . <s> I didn't choose it  --  Priceline gave it to me for  $ 70 . <s> If I'd paid the book rate ;   $ 175 ;  I'd have been less pleased . <s> No troubles with checkin . <s> Very small room but bed was clean and comfortable . <s> Starbucks in the lobby was a godsend . <s> I'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough . <s> For  $ 70 ;  it's a steal . <s> For its online face value ;  not so much . <s> Will definitely return if can get similar price . <s> My experience as Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was horrible . <s> Me and my wife were on a road trip from New York and stopped had reservations for Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel . <s> We arrived at 12 : 00 AM and they did not have a non-smoking room available for which we booked ! <s> My wife was pregnant at the time and the reception staff had no sympathy . <s> My wife couldn't handle the smell of the room so I asked for a refund to go stay somewhere else . <s> They refused and were very rude and unhelpful . <s> We had to stay the night ;  and the first thing next morning we did was leave and look for a different hotel . <s> I will never stay at this hotel again . <s> The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park Hotel was supposed to be our romantic get away and it turned into a nightmare ! <s> When we got there our room wasn't done ! <s> We were not offered anything to do ;  drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the 20 minutes that they said it would be finished . <s> The clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone ! <s> How rude ! <s> We were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done . <s> And after waiting that long for the room ;  can you believe it ? <s> There was a dirty towel in the bathroom . <s> The television didn't work ;  we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it . <s> Plus ;  the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair . <s> I'm so mad I'm writing the owners and letting them know ! <s> This really made me mad . <s> We haven't taken a vacation in years and I was expecting the Fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs . <s> Even the concierge snickered at my boots ;  so what ;  I like to wear Doc Martens ! <s> It makes me mad even thinking about the Fairmont . <s> At least my time in Chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame . <s> Review's a little late ;  but ...  My husband  &  I first stayed at the Amalfi in 8 / 06 totally based on reviews I read on this website . <s> We were totally WOWED !  ! <s> Loved the location ;  the room ;  the Aveda bath products ;  but most of all loved the evening reception  &  breakfast on our floor . <s> I returned to Chicago with 3 girlfriends in 9 / 07 and booked us in a suite at the Amalfi . <s> It was great - room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased ! <s> Will stay next time I'm in Chicago too !  ! <s> P . S . <s> They honor a government rate !  !  !  ! <s> I stayed at the Fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent . <s> I was given a very large room with great views of the city ;  the breakfast was extremely good ;  and the location was as central as I could have wished for . <s> The pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims . <s> In the evening I spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too . <s> Highly recommended as a base for exploring Chicago . <s> Swissotel was the cleanest hotel I have ever stayed in ! <s> The room and bathroom were quite large for downtown Chicago . <s> The pool and hot tub were also very nice . <s> I would definately recommend this hotel . <s> We didn't hear any noise in our room from other guests or from the city . <s> It is in a great location - walking distance to Millenium Park ;  the Loop and Michigan Ave .  <s> James Chicago-A good hotel with friendly and cooperative staff . <s> It is in a prime location near many tourist attractions and restaurants . <s> The room design was modern and welcoming . But I was disappointed to find that the shower took a long time to heat up and that the wifi access was extremely slow . <s> Also ;  the TV only had a few channels and had fuzzy connection . <s> While the bed was comfortable ;  I was annoyed by the street noise at night ;  thin room walls ;  and the small closet space . <s> I was disheartened by the quality of the James . <s> What can I say ...  this USED to be our FAVORITE hotel in Chicago because of its location ;  its historic and gorgeous pool ;  it amazing Sunday brunch ;  it's relatively low price compared to comparable hotels ;  its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership ...  All of the above has fallen disappointingly by the wayside with a resounding THUD . <s> Let's break it down :  Location :  I'll concede that it's still great . <s> Get a corner room in the Historic tower higher than the 20th floor with a view of Michigan Ave and / or the river . <s> Its historic and gorgeous pool :  Closed indefinitely ! <s> When asked when it will re-open ;  the hotel staff actually said ;   " Maybe never . <s>  "  Its amazing Sunday brunch :  Zest is gone ;  and his been replaced by a very dark Michael Jordan restaurant that takes up much of the lobby and second entrance . <s>  ( The lobby ;  by the way ;  used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit . <s> Also no longer ...  )  . <s> The food is very bad . <s> Very . <s> Bad . <s> There are so many restaurants in this city . <s> Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat . <s> Its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels :  Based on my review of everything else . <s> Go to the Drake ;  or the Peninsula . <s> Completely worth the extra money ...  That ;  or downgrade to the Hilton and get what you expect and pay for ... <s> The InterContinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the Hilton ;  but you get a worse experience ! <s> Its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership :  I canceled our membership after this disaster . <s> Part of the membership includes early check-in  ( granted ;  when available )  ...  but our room wasn't ready until 6pm . <s> This is obviously after normal check-in . <s> The staff was overwhelmed ;  and not effective or helpful . <s> I tried to speak with the manager about our room ;  waited in long line to speak with someone ;  only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name . <s> In a nutshell . <s> Go somewhere else . <s> ps :  Go to Argo tea next door instead of the Starbucks in the hotel . <s> Way better food and coffee . <s> The Omni Chicago Hotel was in one word ;  dreadful . <s> The hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic . <s> The service is terrible . <s> If you want to wait for your room for 3 and a half hours this is the place to go ! <s> Throughout a whole week ;  beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned . <s> The hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit ;  they give no info for any activities going on in Chicago . <s> This hotel should be listed in the top 10 WORST hotels in America . <s> Do not waste your time nor money staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel . <s> When my sister got married last summer ;  our stay at the Sheraton Hotel was delightful ! <s> Billy and the kids and I were exhausted after the long flight from San Francisco ;  so it's a good thing that we found the perfect place to relax ! <s> The kids ADORED the indoor pool ;  Billy couldn't stop talking about the beautiful jogging path ;  and I even pampered myself by taking advantage of the massage therapy before the big day . <s> The reception dinner at Shula's Steakhouse was fun and delicious . <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel to any one who is in Chicago for an extended visit ! <s> Got a good deal on a weekend pacage in this Hotel and have to say it is the nicest stay I have had in more than a dozen business trips to Chicago . <s> All rooms are Suites ;  staff is friendly and professional ;  Restaurant is out of this world and all the extras like a great health club ;  turn down service ;  complimentary morning beverages delivered to room and on and on . <s> Room was very clean and every need was attended to without feeling intruded on . <s> Will definately stay here again . <s> Hard Rock Hotel - I had the worst experience checking into the hotel ;  the staff was rude and the first room I stayed at smelled heavily of smoke . <s> I had specifically requested a non-smoking room ;  but they must have missed this . <s> Room quality was typical - everything you would expect and nothing special . <s> The linnen sheets were too thin and felt like low quality . <s> My biggest complaint was the noise - it was simply intollerable ! <s> My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago this past summer . <s> Needless to say we will not be returning ! <s> The Hotel is very overpriced for what you get . <s> Upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had . <s> The bed was very uncomfortable and the  " fully-stocked honor bar "  was stocked with only a few choices . <s> The shower did not even work ! We booked the King Suite with Jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi . <s> I would not recommend this place ! <s> Swissotel Chicago - I just returned from a stay at the Swissotel Chicago and I have to say I was underwhelmed . <s> I had heard great things The Palm from friends ;  but the several times that I went there I was greeted with terrible service and lackluster food at best . <s> Upon checking into my room ;  the mini-refrigerator was not functioning properly ;  so I called down to the front desk ;  the staff could not seem any less interested in helping me if they tried ! <s> Overall a very negative experience ;   I would not stay here again . <s> I was very happy with my stay at the Knickerbocker . <s> The room were nice ;  and the staff was excellent . <s> I was able to stay here for  $ 80 per night thru Priceline . <s> That was an incredible bargain in my opinion  ..  this hotel is very nice . <s> It has an excellent location  ...  just off of Michigan Ave .  All of the best shopping in Chicago can be found right around the corner . <s> It's a great location  ...  very close to many great attractions . <s> If there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool ;  but I think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in Chicago ;  I would definately recommend this place  ...  hopefully I will be able to stay there again in the future . <s> This is an absolutely gorgeous hotel . <s> We had an amazing view of the city ;  especially at night . <s> Our room was luxurious with extremely comfortable beds . <s> There was a desk and chair ;  large bathroom ;  comfortable chair and reading lamp . <s> There was also an area for snacks and a coffee maker ;  that included Starbucks coffee . <s> We would definitely come back again ! <s> This hotel was very beautiful . <s> I went with a group of 4 friends and we had a blast . <s> It was very centrally located and was close to all sorts of transportation . <s> The Continental breakfast was magnificent ! <s> I didn't see much of the staff but all of the men at the front door were extremely helpful . <s> Staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute ;  budget Valentines weekend trip for my husband and me . <s> We got a great rate  --   $ 70  --  on Priceline . <s> Close to the subway  ( red line )  and we got from O'Hare to the hotel in less than an hour for  $ 3 . 50 for both of us . <s> We were able to check in more than 4 hours early . <s> Room was great  --  very clean ;  good closet space and fantastic bedding . <s> Had one expensive drink at the Irish bar ;  but the bartender's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price . <s> Concierge was helpful ;  too . <s> Overall ;  service was terrific ;  room was great and staying there was a treat . <s> I would stay there again any time ;  especially at that price . <s> Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile - I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here ! <s> My son has allergies ;  so the option of their PURE room was really convenient and our room was very spacious . <s> The staff was courteous and accommodating ;  they even provided ice pops for the kids when it was unseasonably hot one day . <s> We were on the 20th floor ;  so we didn’t hear much street noise either . <s> My one complaint was that the website didn’t mention that the swimming pool was under construction for the whole summer ;  I intended to make use of the facility and was disappointed that I couldn’t . <s> When I made my reservations at Softiel in Chicago ;  I was expecting the ultimate in Luxury but Softiel failed to deliver . <s> Everything was just ok . <s> I do not spend money on a quality hotel for  " just ok "  . <s> If I want  " just ok "  I'll check into the Days Inn ! <s> First of all there were problems with our reservation . <s> I asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor ! <s> The desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this . <s> I eventually got it fixed but I certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process . <s> Later when I went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us . <s> The room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure . <s> On the second day of our stay ;  housekeeping did not refill our soaps or coffee . <s> They also failed to empty one of our wastebaskets . <s> Minor I know ;  but when you're paying for a luxury experience ;  you kind of expect luxury ! <s> The hotel itself was nice but the staff really don't deliver . <s> I would not stay here again . <s> You can get a nice clean room at LaQuinta for 1 / 4 the price and the staff is much more helpful . <s> We loved the Talbott . <s> The location was fabulous ... very close to the shopping . <s> The hotel is smaller ;  but the rooms are very nice . <s> They are very spacious and are able to be darkened to sleep well . <s> Also ;  the beds are some of the most comfortable I have ever slept in . <s> I might also add that our room at queen beds . <s> The staff is all friendly and puts them themselves out for you . <s> The hotel has a cute outdoor eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers ;  etc . <s> It looks like a scene out of Europe . <s> I would highly recommend the hotel . <s> We were there with our daughters ;  ages 10 and 13 . <s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago is a wonderful hotel . <s>  :  )  Me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation ;  and it couldn't have been better ! <s> The staff was very polite and helpful ;  and the rooms were very clean ;  and they had some of the best beds I've ever slept on ! <s> Not to mention the view was amazing ! <s> If I had to rate this hotel I'd definitely give it five star ;  next time I'm in town I will most definitely stay there again ! <s> My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one . <s> I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor . <s> When I arrived ;  I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk . <s> I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone . <s> The room was very small and dark . <s> Then the Internet wasn't working . <s> I wasn't informed about this on my check in and couldn't be given a time frame when it would be back up . <s> I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking ;  gathered up my belongings and went there . <s> If you're one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels ;  you'll lurve this place . <s> But if you like a hotel with lights on ;  working internet and a good view and real breakfast ;  go someplace else . <s> Palmer House A Hilton Hotel - The Palmer House is situated in a great location for exploring the city of Chicago . <s> Many of the city’s highlights were within walking distance . <s> I was able to take a nice stroll down to Grant Park from the hotel . <s> Not only were the surroundings a plus ;  the Palmer House offered exceptional service . <s> My room was quite spacious and provided an excellent way to end my days in Chicago . <s> The Lockwood Restaurant prepared fresh local foods and the dinner was exquisite . <s> All in all ;  the Palmer House was a great stay and I would definitely recommend coming here . <s> My stay at the Affinia last weekend was ideal and I can't wait to return . <s> I was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean ;  lovely room near the shopping downtown . <s> Affinia fit the bill . <s> The location was perfect ;  just one block from the magnificent mile . <s> The decor was modern and sleek ;  and my room was impeccably clean . <s> They even have a pillow menu ! <s> The price was pretty reasonable ;  too . <s> I'll definitely be back . <s> WARNING ! <s> My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels . <s> I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends . <s> After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott . <s> They were promoting up to  $ 30 breakfast credit per day . <s> And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time . <s> Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee  ( which we wouldn't have known had he not told us )  that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group . <s> Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved . <s> If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6 ;  not a luxury hotel in Chicago . <s> The linens were stained ;  room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee . <s> I was truly disgusted . <s> After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep . <s> The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests . <s> I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten . <s> The toast was stale ;  eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs ;  and the juice they served was sour . <s> I would never recommend this as a place to stay . <s> I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime . <s> I used to stay at the Homewood Suites all the time on business but have not stayed there on business since 2005 - since that time my company has been doing business in the suburbs instead of downtown . <s> During December of 2007 and this year 2008 I did stay there a few days with my family and was greeted as if I never left . <s> There is a lady named Connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before . <s> A wonderful lady indeed - my wife even commented to me on the way to Chicago if that lady would still be there and would still remember and yes she does ! <s> Its a great place to stay . <s> If anyone is traveling to Chicago ;  I would strongly recommend the Palmer House Hilton . <s> I have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and I was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel . <s> I had a guest room with a double bed . <s> At the first sight ;  the room had perfect decor . <s> The double bed looked comfy and cozy . <s> It wasn't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me . <s> Since I was in a hurry in my two-day stay ;  I didn't have time to wander around the town for food . <s> It wasn't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks . <s> The good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night . <s> I can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks . <s> If you are just touring the city ;  the hotel is quite close to parks ;  museum ;  and a lot of shopping places . <s> If you just need a place to stay ;  the view from the hotel was pretty good as well . <s> Among all the hotels I have spent time in ;  the Palmer House Hilton tops the list . <s> i was in chicago from september 17-22 for a convention ..  my company booked this hotel for me . <s> the hotel is centrally located  ;  michican ave is less than a block away . <s> perfect location ! <s> the suites are huge with comfy beds and a beautiful kitchenette . <s> breakfast is the best ...  bountiful ..  not just muffins and toast ...  i mean everything you can imagine ... waffles ;  bacon ;  sausage  ;  hash browns ;  toast ;  danishes ;  omelets ;  burritos ;  all freshly made ...  not artifical ...  really good . <s> and clean  ..  also they have a free dinner ...  buffet ..  excellent ...  mexican night ;  chinese night ;  american fare ..  all included ..  wine and beer also ..  well worth the expensive price of  $ 279 a night . <s> a very classy and clean hotel ..  i love chicago ...  will come again ! <s> Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park  --  The Fairmont Chicago hotel is quite nice . <s> I was impressed by the amount of sunlight my room received  ( my room's windows faced south )  . <s> A lot of hotels have well decorated rooms but without good lighting the room can still feel off ;  but the Fairmont Chicago does not make this mistake . <s> I was disappointed by the provided moisturizer but I have sensitive skin so I brought my own just in case . <s> I liked the proximity of the hotel to the fantastic sushi restaurant down the street . <s> Overall this was quite the comfortable  ( and delicious )  stay . <s> My husband and I recently visited the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel on one of his business trips . <s> I sometimes go along with him to see new places and to splurge on a mini-vacation while he is hard at work  ( don't worry- he likes when I return with little  " souvenirs "  for him ;  too )  . <s> Aside from the lovely city of Chicago ;  this hotel was just amazing ! <s> We had gotten in quite late that evening from our flight from Houston and were so tired ! <s> The staff was genuine and friendly ;  all while being professional and prompt . <s> We were quickly checked in and before we knew it we were in our beautiful room . <s> Too tired to really take it in ;  we were in bed and asleep in minutes . <s> The beds were quite welcoming ! <s> It wasn't until the next morning that we were able to really take in all of the beautiful features of this hotel ! <s> It's gorgeous ! <s> Everything was so clean and wonderfully decorated ! <s> The lobby somehow didn't make it into our sleepy eyes the night before ;  but it was just lovely ! <s> Later that evening we decided to eat at their sushi restaurant . <s> Sushi is one of my husband's favorites ;  so he tends to be picky . <s> They passed the test according to him ! <s> We also enjoyed a glass of wine there as well ...  everything tasted great and was of excellent quality . <s> Of our two night stay there ;  the only downfall was one occasion of there not being enough towels  ( I use a lot of towels I suppose )  . <s> However ;  a simple phone called prompted a quick delivery of fluffy additional ones . <s> This however was only a minor bump in the road to an entirely enjoyable and relaxing stay ! <s> Overall --  we'd love to go there again ! <s> Maybe next time I can talk my husband into taking advantage of the spa ...  *wink* <s> Hard Rock Chicago  - We heard good reviews of this hotel online ;  and so when we were going to Chicago for a week ;  we decided it would be a nice place to stay . <s> Yes ;  the rooms are nice â€“ beautiful even â€“ but for us it just wasnâ€™t worth the price . <s> The place was loud ;  which we probably should have expected given the theme ;  but we were assured it wouldnâ€™t be an issue . <s> Still we could have gotten by that ;  had we been made to feel at home . <s> The staff were cold and unfriendly ;  and were often a disaster to deal with . <s> We would ask for stuff to be brought up to our room ;  and it would take them close to three hours to finally bring it . <s> Link - http :  /  / www . omnihotels . com / FindAHotel / Chicago . aspx  Hotel Name - Omni Hotels  Negative Deception -  First let me be honest -  The employees were really humble and well trained . <s> However it all ended there . <s> The room I was offered had horrible vicinity . <s> There was a construction site right next to the room and there was noise all day in . <s> To add to the woes ;  there were workers who could directly peep into my window all throughout the day . <s> The room was poorly maintained and the door of wardrobe fell off my hand when I tried hanging my coat . <s> However the staff was very helpful and cooperative and they fixed it as soon as I brought it to their notice . <s> The food was the biggest failure . <s> I had ordered a vegan dish and they messed my order and landed up serving us steak along with mashed potatoes . <s> I got my wife along with me who's from Eastern part to show how good city Chicago is but it was a massive failure . <s> I would certainly not recommend this hotel to anyone who plans to visit Chicago . <s> My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad ;  not really knowing it's location . <s> We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave .   ( It's connect to Nordstroms right in the heart of downtown . <s>  )  Great for shopping . <s> The hotel itself was fabulous . <s> The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants . <s> I recommend going to Joe's that's right across the street from the hotel . <s> Everyone was raving about it  . <s>  . <s>  . but we couldn't get a reservation . <s> The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable . <s> It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere . <s> My husband loved the workout room . <s> I highly recommend the Conrad !  ! <s> Hotel Allegro - I recently had a business trip in Chicago and unfortunately stayed at the Hotel Allegro . <s> There was a clerk named Marie who was extremely rude at check-in . <s> When I wanted to switch rooms ;  because the room did not resemble the room on the website ;  they did not accommodate my needs . <s> The room was much smaller than anticipated ;  with rumpled sheets and definitely not enough moisturizer . <s> The toilet also clogged very easily . <s> Although the evening wine hour was superb ;  it did not make up for the other faults of the hotel ! <s> I would not recommend a stay for any amount of time at Hotel Allegro . <s> I stayed in the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend ;  and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels . <s> The spacious rooms with modern ;  innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small ;  dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that I have found at other hotel chains . <s> The bathrooms were neat ;  tidy ;  and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper ;  shampoo ;  and soap . <s> The carpet was clean  ( not stained and dingy like some hotels )  ;  the room decor was astounding ;  and the view from our window was wonderful . <s> I enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay ;  from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out . <s> Thanks for making me feel right at home ! <s> This hotel is totally overrated . <s> Yes ;  the location is awesome ;  but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options . <s> The customer service ;  or lack thereof ;  was particularly disappointing . <s> Why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady ? <s> Even when her hands are full . <s> The housekeeping staff couldn't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day . <s> Why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don't bring it anyway . <s> As stated previously ;  the location is great . <s> Location ;  however ;  does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff . <s> I would not stay here again . <s> We booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night . <s> We walked over to the Talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay . <s> The room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom . <s> The tub is large and the shower a pleasure . <s> The location was quiet as requested . <s> The staff was always cheerful and very helpful . <s> Tim and Stephanie provide excellent concierge services ! <s> The breakfast at the Basil Cafe is a great way to start the day . <s> We travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel . <s> I would highly recommend the Talbott for your stay . <s> Talbott Hotel - Pricey ;  inconvenient and a scam are all words I could use to describe my terrible time at the Talbott Hotel . <s> The service was slow ;  and  " Greg ;  "  the concierge goon obviously showed he didn't want to be there ;  a feeling I can empathize with . <s> The room was plenty big but that means nothing when it is untidy and dirty . <s> When I first got there ;  the linens were obviously discolored by acts of which I shall not speak . <s> The service was slow in responding ;  so I went down to the market restaurant for a drink . <s> The restraunt itself was extremely cramped and the chairs were so close I was basically sticking my nose where it did not belong . <s> The food was mediocre ;  the lemon taste was too sour and the ribs were drenched in disgusting barbeque sauce . <s> When my room was finally ready ;  I realized how small the room really was . <s> The brown coloring on everything was so drab and boring . <s> The bathroom was suitable for a midget since it was so small . <s> All I can say is do not stay here unless you like bad service ;  cramped rooms and terrible food . <s> The loud noises coming from all directions did not help either . <s> Over all ;  my trip was great ;  I got to spend time with my best friend . <s> We did some shopping and site seeing . <s> Trip was overall great . <s> The only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels I have stayed at . <s> Some of the walls had wall paper missing ;  most of the faucets leaked ;  there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms ;  some of the furniture had very visible stains ;  the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom . <s> we stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711 . <s> Considering what ones pays for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity . <s> I do not plan on staying there again . <s> Apart from the trip was great ! <s> [] <s> The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby . <s> In other words ;  come here for the looks ;  not the amenities . <s> They make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process ....  you know ;  because a simple washing machine just isn't good enough . <s> To me ;  this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being  " rich "  -- which most of them are not . <s> Meanwhile ;  the hotel doesn't even offer free wireless -- an essential feature for business travelers like me . <s> Obviously I'm not the intended consumer ;  though ;  so I guess I shouldn't be surprised . <s> We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend . <s> We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10 : 00 a . m .  ;  and they were able to give us our rooms early . <s> Hooray ! <s> We were on the 5th floor  ( Beatles theme )  . <s> The rooms were very comfortable . <s> One of our rooms was on a corner ;  and had lots of windows . <s> The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows . <s> Not a great view from our side of the hotel ;  but we didn't pay for a room with a view . <s> The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable ;  the bathroom was full of Aveda products ;  and there was a bathrobe in the closet . <s> The tv / dvd / stereo combo was nice ;  but we weren't in the room a lot to use it . <s> We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks / drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged . <s> No problems there . <s> We did not make use of the free fitness center ;  because the weather was perfect . <s> My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead . <s> He said it was wonderful . <s> We did use the free internet in our rooms . <s> It was 'wired' internet ;  but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway . <s> The room was a bit dim at night ;  but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps . <s> There was virtually no hall  /  elevator noise . <s> The location of the Hard Rock is ideal . <s> It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery ;  just blocks to either Grant Park ;  The Art Institute ;  State Street Shopping ;  or Michigan Ave .  To sum up ;  there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about . <s> We would be glad to stay here again any time . <s> Move beyond the rock theme and it's an average hotel with a good location . <s> Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing . <s> Thank goodness the window opened or we'd have been cooked alive . <s> That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave . <s> This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting . <s> Room was stuffy too . <s> Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions . <s> Wife happy w /  Aveda in bath . <s> Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey . <s> Not impressed at ALL . <s> The hotel itself looks really nice ;  especially in the big foyer area . <s> Our room was small ;  and the bathroom needed some major upgrades . <s> It had the green tile ;  like at your grandmother's house ;  all over the walls ;  and 2 people couldn't fit in it if you tried . <s> We could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning ;  so obvioulsy the walls aren't so thick . <s> Our room looked directly on to a brick building outside ;  VERY close ;  we couldn't even tell if it was nice outside or not . <s> We are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it ;  and I felt yucky the whole time in it . <s> I just wouldn't pay lots of money to stay here ;  there is nothing exceptional about it at all . <s> We paid  $ 75 a night through Priceline ;  which is excellent for June . <s> Our room had a fantastic view of the Hancock Building and the river . <s> The room was large ;  clean and had a couch ;  easy chair and desk chair . <s> The bedding was the newer 'non-bedspread' style ;  the bed was comfortable ;  the bathroom was large and ;  well ;  we were pleased with the room and the Hyatt in every way . <s> We ate at the lobby restaurant ;  which is attractively decorated and was bustling with activity when we were there . <s> We only got Cobb Salads ;  so I don't know if the food ;  in general ;  is good or not . <s> The Cobb was so-so . <s> Our only complaint was the  $ 48 fee to park your car over-night and the  $ 13 daily fee for the internet . <s> Many places are offering free internet these days and I wish the Hyatt would hop on board with this concept . <s> We hated to leave ! <s> Beautiful historic hotel  --  and since I'm in historic building business ;  was looking forward to stay . <s> Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite ;  they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up  --  duct work torn apart in bathroom ;  lamp fixtures literally falling off wall ;  mirror torn off wall ;  etc . <s> Ended up in a room on 20th floor  --  much nicer ;  but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions . <s> Only two of three elevators to top floors work  --  and these two elevators skip floors ;  so you can be stuck waiting for ever . <s> When I raised this to hotel staff ;  was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it . <s> Umm ;  no . <s> This is not an old building problem ;  this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it . <s> Thumbs way down ;  stay away . <s> Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if you're looking for old world charm ;  sans hassle . <s> When I walked into the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel ;  my first thought was  ;  " wow this is very yellow "  ;  and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day ;  no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse . <s> my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in . <s> It was a Victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms . <s> i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms . <s> The hotel lost our reservations and then couldin't accommodate what we needed . <s> they gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request . <s> we opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations ;  they still charged us an early check out fee . <s> If it wasn't for the great location of the hotel ;  there would be nothing positive to say /  <s> This hotel cannot be beat for location ;  price ;   &  atmosphere . <s> The location is ideal ;  at the corner of State  &  Kinzie . <s> There are fantastic restaurants  &  bars all around ;  including House of Blues  &  Harry Caray's . <s> We stayed in a  " Corner King "  room . <s> The room was amazing . <s> Two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows . <s> Even just being on the 5th floor ;  we had great views of the surrounding area . <s> The decor and amenities are unmatched . <s> The decor is very clean  &  simple but luxurious . <s> The hotel is easy to miss from street level ;  but shouldn't be . <s> The staff were extremely friendly and accommodating . <s> Its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around River North ;  State Street shopping ;  or Clark Street nightlife . <s> Even if you'll be on the Mag Mile ;  this is a short cab ride away . <s> We've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice ! <s> My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton . <s> We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work . <s> Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for . <s> First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos . <s> The floors looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while in the check in area . <s> The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side . <s> The staff was horrible . <s> We had asked for a turn down service it was never received . <s> I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone . <s> Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton . <s> The staff recognizes you by name with excellent eye contact . <s> The  " welcome back "  sets the tone for your stay . <s> Flowers in the lobby and reception area beautiful . <s> The house-keeping staff is terrific ;  helpful and prompt . <s> Room service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too . <s> Pump Room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients . <s> Well done ! <s> My girlfriends and I stayed 4 nights at the Talbott returning home on Saturday 9 / 29 . <s> We all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel . <s> The staff from top to bottom were excellent ;  accommodating . <s> The room was roomy ... with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town . <s> The construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk ;  but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty . <s> The doorman ;  Andrew was an excellent source at this hotel . <s> He arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants . <s> We enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city . <s> The hotel was expensive but met expectations . <s> This hotel is absolutely beautiful . <s> I is elegant ;  comfortable and a very relaxing stay . <s> It was easy to get to the airport and very close to shopping . <s> I felt like a king in a castle surrounded by luxury and beauty . <s> I would recommend this hotel to anyone . <s> I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three . <s> I absolutely loved it and will definitely return ! <s> The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic . <s> They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay . <s> For the nights we didn't want to go out ;  we had room service . <s> The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick . <s> I also loved their commitment to the environment . <s> It is clear to me why they have won so many awards . <s> Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay ! <s> This is one of the best hotels I have ever been in . <s> I went there to see about scheduling my reception party ;  and was amazed at the architecture of the building ;  the interior design of the rooms ;  and the massive spacing provided for each room . <s> Now I recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the James Club ;  so that after the meetings ;  we can partake in a nice meal and drinks . <s> Which brings me to my next point . <s> The James has some of the BEST food I have ever eaten !  !  ! <s> The James Private Club ;  I feel was made for the elite and upper class . <s> Very classy ;  very elegant . <s> The customer service is outstanding . <s> I recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception ;  business meeting ;  or just need to have a day at the spa . <s> 5 stars all the way !  !  ! <s> At the InterContinental Chicago ;  you pay for more than a room . <s> You pay for an experience . <s> Let me elaborate . <s> I was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities . <s> Like any novice traveller to Chicago ;  I saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs ;  and those were originally what I set my sights on . <s> Price is a powerful signal ;  and the sheer discount of those options drew me in . <s> But after doing a bit of research ;  I realised that distance does have its costs . <s> The price of transit in the Chicagoland area isn't free . <s> And it's far from what I'm used to . <s> Car use is price prohibitive . <s>  ( I knew that originally ;  which is why I wasn't going to drive . <s>  )  But the sting of using the automobile  ( parking ;  congestion ;  toll roads ;  etc . <s>  )  gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental . <s> So ;  I ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit . <s> But mass transit has its costs too ;  which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages . <s> That's what originally drew me to InterContinental . <s> But InterContinental is much more than the right room at the right place . <s> The decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable . <s> I was travelling on international business ;  so the ease with which I could transact in foreign currency was a draw . <s>  ( They had a currency exchange right there on the premises . <s>  )  And the fact that massages ;  dry cleaning ;  and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus . <s> My work gets me tied up in knots . <s> It also leaves little time for doing chores . <s> So the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me . <s> But ;  on top of all that ;  the event planning was what put InterContinental over the top . <s> Being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of Chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders -- and something I won't forget . <s> In the end ;  if you're a newcomer to Chicago staying in a time-crunch ;  the InterContinental is for you . <s> The pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive ;  but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs ;  it's nothing in the end . <s> And the InterContinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options ;  it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be . <s> My husband and I stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend . <s> It was far from that ! <s> We could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain ;  the person who answered the phone was extremely rude ! <s> We were unable to relax at all ! <s> Also ;  the room was not very clean ;  there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock . <s> We will not be returning to this awful place ! <s> I recently stayed at The James during a business trip to Chicago and I would certainly recommend it . <s> The hotel is well located in downtown ;  only a few blocks from millenium park and other attractions . <s> The room was very nice ;  with a soft bed and plenty of windows and natural light . <s> I also had the opportunity to use the Gym ;  which was well equipped and had even an instructor which gave me some tips . <s> I wasn't too impressed by the restaurant though . <s> Food was rather boring and the place very pretentious . <s> Nevertheless  ; price was fair for a hotel of its class and staff were helpful and very competent . <s> The lobby of the Homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining room ( actually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up )  . <s> The odors from the kitchen were disgusting ;  and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchen ( I . e . <s> hospital )  . <s> The free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable . <s> I suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were ;  that makes this hotel a good value . <s> But i would not stay here again . <s> Although much too overpriced in my opinion ;  the hotel is spotless . <s> The staff was very courteous . <s> And the spa service  ? <s> Was a God send  ! <s> In a relatively flexible location for traveling for sight seeing so I didnt spend major bucks trying to get around the city  ! <s> LOVE IT  ! <s> Going back for my anniversary <s> OK ;  we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating . <s> I can't believe the bad reviews . <s> I got a priceline deal ;  and I still got a fine room ;  clean ;  up-to-date furnishings  ( OK a little traditional for my taste )  and smoke free . <s> Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews . <s> I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth . <s> Here it is from my point of view . <s> Both rooms on 10th floor . <s> Regarding the size of the rooms . <s> We had two rooms . <s> One was a 2 double bed room . <s> It was about 20' x 15' . <s> Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies . <s> The furniture ;  bathroom tile ;  shower  ( no tub )  ;  wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years . <s> A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV ;  coffeemaker ;  ice bucket ;  and mini-bar . <s> Three separate levels  ( TV ;  ice / coffee ;  and minibar )  The other room was called  " Queen executive "  . <s> This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence ;  sofabed ;  two TVs and terry bathrobes . <s> Also about the same size but different configerations . <s> One TV faced the bed ;  other in the three level cabinet ;  the sofabed . <s> Smoke in the lobby . <s> There is a bar to the right of the entrance . <s> It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door . <s> No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms . <s> Cost of rooms  $ 75 on priceline plus taxes . <s> Very good value one block from N .  Michigan Ave .  Only complaint . <s> Concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum / Museum complex when in fact it does . <s> Was this ignorance ? <s> or trying to throw more business to taxi ? <s> Either case ;  not good . <s> He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter .... which is clearly incorrect . <s> The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy . <s> The room had a great view of a lake . <s> Room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee . <s> There was a business center that had internet ;  fax machines ;  and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day . <s> One of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs ;  it was exactly what I needed ;  very relaxing . <s> The food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate ;  I never wanted to leave . <s> This was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again . <s> Our check-in was great ;  but then we got into our room . <s> The carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower  ( open concept )  leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it . <s> The mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room . <s> Our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect .... 1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize ;  and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine  (  $ 69 instead of  $ 50 )  . <s> When my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected ;  he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee . <s> It was adjusted ;  but not without confrontation . <s> There was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same  " mysterious "  mini bar charge on her bill as well ;  and was trying to have it corrected . <s> Overall ;  the location of the Hard Rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one ;  <s> The Hotel Monaco Chicago was a great hotel . <s> The rooms were very nice ;  great customer service . <s> Every member of the staff was extremely nice . <s> I liked that it was pet friendly ;  and you couldn't even tell they allowed pets . <s> Very clean . <s> Prompt service when requested ;  and the food was very tasty ! <s> An A+ in my book ;  the prices were very reasonable as well since it is a four star hotel . <s> Very immaculate . <s> Will definitely stay there again the next time I visit Chicago . <s> The Swisshotel is awesome . <s> Very high class . <s> It is expensive  ;  but so is every hotel in Chicago . <s> It is off from the dingy areas of our city  ;  yet a long walk to Navy Pier ;  so you will need to pay for the cab . <s> Note to all the Magnificent Mile is boring as can be . <s> I live in Chicago and the hotel is a better experience than the Mile of Navy  ( BORING )  Pier . <s> My husband and I were planning our 1st year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in Chicago where we had first met . <s> After spending several minutes frustratingly navigating The Talbott Hotel's website ;  I FINALLY was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend . <s> After a long flight into Chicago ;  we were so ready to check in ;  shower ;  and lay down in our hotel room . <s> However ;  once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation . <s> I provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied . <s> She begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting . <s> We then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door . <s> I'm severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel . <s> Very disappointed in our stay in Chicago Monoco . <s> We have stayed many times elsewhere ;  primarily in washington DC and are accustomed to great customer service ;  beverages like water or soda at the wine bar ;  coffee and papers in the morning ;  help with bags . <s> Not only did the Chicago monoco do none of these things ;  the staff was not helpful ;  either . <s> Requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there . <s> YOu got the feeling you were  " bothering "  people if you asked a question . <s> No bellman ;  the doorman did not open the door or help with bags . <s> Even though we were traveling with a child ;  I had to request a fish when they did not bring it . <s> Really baffling ..  as we love the Monoco in Washington . <s> Pleasant staff and housekeeping . <s> Above average breakfast . <s> The rooms were clean and the staff made sure we had fresh linnens . <s> It was bedbug free !  ! <s> I would definitely stay there again . <s> The Ambassador East Hotel Hello my current visit to the Ambassador East Hotel . <s> I really enjoy my 3 day weekend stay at this Hotel . <s> This was my first time at the hotel and I reserved a king size suite . <s> Inside my room there was nice view of Chicago's Gold Coast . <s> I really needed to get some work done for my business trip and this room was perfect for the situation . <s> I could easily relax on my king size bed . <s> I watch HBO on a enormous size flat screen TV for free . <s> Also when I did do my work there was nice wooden desk in my room with a desk lamp and wifi modem . <s> It so nice to have my laptop with me and able to use it on a good workstation in my room . <s> After finishing my work I have time to check the complimentary fitness room . <s> Lastly I left the next day ;  I had one of the finest breakfast dishes from their Pump Room restaurant . <s> Overall the Ambassador East Hotel is a 5 out 5 hotel and really worth the stay . <s> at check in ;  the girl gave us a smoking room . <s> we asked for nonsmoking . <s> i had to get another room . <s> it was by the elevators . <s> loud ! <s> really loud !  . <s> the new room didn't have a shower door . <s> so every day water spilled on to the floor and wet the carpet . <s> the public transportation is amazing . <s> you don't need a car in chicago . <s> you can get anywhere by train or bus . <s> it's fast too . <s> Area recommendations chicago is great ! <s> good shopping ;  good food  ( ginos east !  !  ! <s>  )  and great bars . <s> the tornado that knocked out the windows in the sears tower was really cool ! <s> i loved being in the hardest rain storm i've ever seen ! <s> We were checked into a room with empty beer bottles ; dirty shorts in the closet and an unclean bathroom . <s> There was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints . <s> The front desk lady said the manager was on a LUNCH break at 7 PM !  !  !  !  !  !  ! <s> We missed our show at Navy Pier because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc . <s> Finally when I got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience !  !  ! <s> This was totally inappropiate since I had children including a teenager with me . <s> She gave me a  $ 30 compensation for ruining our family holiday !  !  !  ! <s> Staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night . <s> They kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets . <s> I asked for two blanket ;  but they delivered one . <s> I had to keep calling to get settled for the night . <s> I saw a filled out comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk ;  who had taken the trouble of filling it out ;  but no one collected it or cared for it . <s> Noisy rooms . <s> Can hear the doors open and close all night . <s> The breakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished . <s> I will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates !  ! <s> I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list . <s> The room had such a strong odor of smoke ;  it gave me a headache  ( and I used to be a smoker )  ! <s> The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive . <s> The hotel is disturbingly huge . <s> Very difficult to navigate your way around it . <s> I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located . <s> She curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up . <s> Uhhhhh ;  how do I know which direction to go in ?  ?  ? <s> Stains on the carpet in the room . <s> A big gauge in the wall ;  where maybe a thermostat once was ?  ?  ? <s> The shower is decent . <s> All in all ;  for the price they charge ;  NO THANKS !  !  ! <s> I'm just glad my company is footing the bill . <s> Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief ;  they need more than two elevators . <s> You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor  ( registration desk on 6th floor )  ;  you can face a long line just to catch one . <s> Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites - very utilitarian ;  unlike many locations however ;  this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms . <s> The pool is OK but there's no jacuzzi . <s> Oh ;  and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area . <s> Front desk service is pretty good . <s> Eww ! <s> What a sickening affair ;  the Hotel Monaco Chicago is a stuffy masterpiece of a hotel done wrong . <s> I stayed there recently and the rooms reek of the pretended elite classes whom fill its rooms . <s> I seriously was afraid to even lie between the sheets for fear of being charged a hefty linens fee ... <s> I stayed in Chicago for a week ;  I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for one night ! <s> I was here on business so I needed to get some rest the next day but the walls were so thin that I could here all the carrying on in the neighbors room till 3 am . <s> This was very beautiful building the room was a lot smaller than I expected and the staff were not very friendly . <s> The person at the front desk had no personality ;  did not even welcome me to the hotel . <s> All in all I don't think I will be back . <s> After a recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago ;  I left the city with an empty pocket book . <s> I had booked a package deal online and although the service was absolutely terrific ;  i didn't realize some of the amenities i was paying for included personalized key cards and room service menus . <s> I could have done with out my room key having my name printed across it as well as the menu . <s> When did my name printed on things become an extra amenity that cost so much money ? <s> I basically felt overcharged for the so called 'extras' included in the package i purchased . <s> One other thing ;  the traffic was pretty horrible and checking in seems like it could have somehow been made simpler . <s> This hotel is beautiful ;  it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it . <s> The location is wonderful ; it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier ;  which was a great place to show the children on our vacation . <s> We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car ; and the valet was very nice and helpful . <s> I also take my work with me everywhere I go ; So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus . <s> They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing . <s> This place is great for the price ;  due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is . <s> This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay . <s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago â€“ I have stayed there for 3 days last week and ;  looking for something better than usual ;  I have paid for the Superior Room . <s> It was a bad choice . <s> The room smelled bad and the TVâ€™s remote control was broken . <s> Also ;  the maid woke me up in one of the days ;  even with a sign saying not to disturb me outside the door . <s> Iâ€™ll never come back to this hotel and I wouldnâ€™t recommend it to anyone . <s> My recent stay at the Talbott Hotel in Chicago was miserable . <s> My visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation . <s> I had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me  " in the system "  . <s> We finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over . <s> That process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations . <s> The room that I had originally reserved  ( King )  was not available and I had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a Double room . <s> I was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that I decided to stay in and order room service . <s> It took an hour and a half for my food to arrive . <s> When finally delivered ;  it was cold and not exactly how I had ordered it . <s> So now I am cranky ;  tired and starving ! <s> I ate what I could from the mini bar  ( poor selection of items )  and went to bed . <s> The room was spacious but had a stale smell to it ;  as if someone had smoked in it . <s> The next morning I complained and wanted to change rooms . <s> The woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way . <s> I decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in Chicago . <s> I will never waste my time or money at The Talbott again . <s> The Omni Chicago Hotel was a delight to stay in . <s> The second you step into the place ;  it takes your breath away . <s> It's very modern with an antique twist . <s> The rooms are spacious and comfortable . <s> They are clean . <s> Every member of the staff was courteous and polite . <s> Proud of their place of work . <s> Happy to be there . <s> You don't often see that . <s> The room service was phenomenal . <s> Visiting Chicago was amazing ;  and staying at the Omni Hotel made my visit that much better . <s> The luxurious pools were an added plus as well . <s> I also enjoyed the gym facilities . <s> I will definitely be staying at the Omni Hotel on my next visit . <s> Sheraton Chicago - I recently stayed 4 nights at the Sheraton for a business trip ;  and I must say that it is among the nicest hotels that I have ever stayed at . <s> Although the room I stayed in did not have a spectacular view ;  it was very clean and cozy so I was completely satisfied . <s> The bathroom was beautifully decorated ;  and the room very spacious :  there was plenty of storage room in the closet as well as workspace on the two tables . <s> We had a company dinner at Shula's Steakhouse downstairs ;  and the food was delicious ;  definitely deserving of the Top 10 Steakhouses in America award . <s> What was also convenient was the fact that there is a FedEx office in the hotel ;  so when my wife overnighted an important document I had forgotten at home ;  the hotel had it delivered right to my room . <s> Overall ;  it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend the Sheraton for anyone spending time in central Chicago . <s> You made Chicago a wonderful stay ! <s> The room was gorgeous ! <s> I came with very little on hand and my deluxe room supplied me with everything that I needed ;  I didn't even have to ask ! <s> Thank you so much ;  I will be back ! <s> Very tidy room as well ! <s> Everything experienced at this hotel was grand . <s> The hotel itself is stunning and the architecture is amazing . <s> From the moment you walk into The Palmer House ;  you are greeted by friendly helpful staff . <s> The rooms are out of this world with no detail overlooked . <s> Comfortable beds ;  amazing bathrooms and breathtaking views of Chicago . <s> If you are looking for an extravagant hotel for your next visit to the windy city ;  i would definately recommend you stay here . <s> Experience Chicago like never before . <s> As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro ;  I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left . <s> She seems to have a cough today . <s> In the room on my right ;  someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit . <s> I hear the water running and the toilet flushing . <s> I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs . <s> Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms . <s> I've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst . <s> The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains ;  the curtains with a large brown stain  ( I don't want to guess what it is )  ;  paint peeling ;  rips in the wallpaper . <s> The decor is a bit garish ;  with Pepto-Bismol covered walls ;  green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet . <s> The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable ;  but I'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others' toilets flushing all night . <s> The location is good for downtown theaters or business . <s> Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly . <s> Chicago has many nice hotel options  --  many I've enjoyed quite a bit . <s> Unfortunately this is not one of them ;  and even more unfortunate for me :  I'm stuck here for two more nights . <s> I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip ;  comfortable and attractive . <s> This is not . <s> Upon arrival at the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago ;  I was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff . <s> From the moment we checked-in until we left ;  the staff ;  from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating . <s> Since we had our two daughters with us ;  we booked the traditional double room . <s> The room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too . <s> It had plenty of room for the four of us -- or should I say five of us . <s> The girls did not want to leave home without ChiChi ;  our teacup Chihuahua . <s> Fortunately ;  the Amabassador East allows small pets  ( with a pet waiver )  . <s> That made everybody happy ! <s> The location is great as well . <s> Conviently located . <s> Easy to get to from Lakeshore Drive . <s> Close to the museums . <s> I'm looking forward to my next visit to Chicago . <s> I'll be staying here again ! <s> Millennium- I stayed at the Millennium in Chicago last month for three nights . <s> I’ve never had a better hotel experience ! <s> Everything from the room service to the hotel bar was perfect . <s> The only thing complaint I can think about is that sometimes in the morning the maid service would be too loud in the hallway and wake me up . <s> All in all ;  my stay in the Millennium was great ! <s> Anyone who’s looking for an affordable stay in a luxury hotel should definitely check out the Millennium . <s> My family and I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers with the belief our stay would be a 5 star experience . <s> That was the farthest thing from the truth . <s> The staff was very rude and unhelpful . <s> The hotel is so large that you will get lost if you dont have the help of the staff . <s> Once we did find our room our card would not get us in and we had to start all over . <s> So overall it took over an hour just to get us in a room . <s> As we entered the room we noticed a foul smell that we just overlooked because we were happy to just finally be able to rest . <s> My wife went to the bathroom ;  and to our amazement there was what appeared to be dog hair all over the tub and tile floor . <s> That was just the beginning of our bad stay . <s> After being in the room for about 30 minutes ;  there was a knock at the door that just happened to be the Chicago police . <s> There was a report of the smell of marijuana coming from the room ! <s> My family was put through a series of embarrasing questions and actually had our luggage and personal belongings searched . <s> There was a small amount of marijuana found in the drawer of the dresser that we never touched . <s> Come to find out after video surveillance ;  the cleaning lady was arrested for possession of marijuana . <s> Needless to say ;  our stay at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers was the worst part of our vacation and I would not recommend anyone to stay at this place . <s> I had never been to Chicago and was looking forward to sightseeing after my business conference . <s> My company had arranged for me to stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel located in the center of the Magnificent Mile . <s> Once I arrived at the hotel and gave it the once over ;  I was pleased but not impressed . <s> Once I put down by luggage and inquired about my reservation . <s> I was told that my room was not ready yet and that there'd be an hour delay . <s> I tried not to lose my temper and pleasantly asked if I could have another room . <s> I was told there was a convention going on in the hotel and every room was filled . <s> I would have left ;  but my company had a account at this hotel . <s> If I stayed somewhere else ;  I'd have to pay out of pocket . <s> The service employee behind the counter flippantly told me to take a seat and went back to talking with his gum-chewing co-worker . <s> I picked up my luggage and plopped down in a cushy chair that wobbled . <s> The leg in front on the left side was broken . <s> I picked up my luggage and moved to another chair . <s> Two hours passed by before I was given my room . <s> When I walked into the room the first thing I smelled was cigarette smoke . <s> I was mad because I explicitly asked for a  " non-smoking "  room . <s> I was furious . <s> I didn't feel like going back downstairs and dealing with the idiot behind the counter and I was tried from my long flight . <s> I sighed ;  tipped the bellboy and slammed the door to my room . <s> I thought maybe I could use the air conditioning to freshen the room . <s> When I went to turn it on ;  it didn't work . <s> Tired and angry ;  I went to sleep ;  thinking I'll never stay at this hotel again . <s> My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Monaco for 5 days in October ;  2007 . <s> I cannot begain to tell you how great this place is . <s> The service was impecable and the room was fantastic . <s> Huge window seat to look over Chicago . <s> It was great . <s> The wine reception in the evening was a special treat as was the morning coffee service in the lobby . <s> This was our first trip to Chicago and I hope not our last . <s> I will definately stay at Hotel Monaco again when we return . <s> We booked our room through a safety convention web site . <s> This is my second time here in two months ;  both stays were great . <s> The rooms are very nice and very clean . <s> The staff is terrific and always attentive . <s> My only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk . <s> Terrible experience ;  I will not stay here again . <s> The walls were so thin that I was kept up all night by the party going on in the suite next to mine . <s> I talked to the management several times ;  but nothing was done . <s> It may just be the people that I had contact with ;  but I thought the staff was standoffish and rude . <s> Very unpleasant experience ;  especially given the cost of staying here !

<s> The pictures on the website with regard to this  " gym "  are completely misleading . <s> Look ;  if this place marketed itself as a 3 star hotel  ( AND the price reflected it )  ;  then perhaps my stay would have been adequate . <s> But I can't forgive the false advertising and general snotty atmosphere from what is really no better than any 3 star hotel . <s> Save some money ;  stay in the Holiday Inn . <s> Or if you really want a luxurious experience ;  look elsewhere . <s> } <s> I truly enjoyed my stay at the Omni Chicago Hotel . <s> We stayed in a suite ;  which was clean and extremely nice ;  at a very reasonable rate . <s> My husband and I spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool ;  but personally I preferred laying out on the sundeck . <s> Service was excellent ;  they were friendly and all of our needs were met promptly . <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great experience in the downtown Chicago area . <s> Conrad Chicago it was 5 : 00 AM my plan just flew in and I was tired I checked myself into the Confad Chicago when I first got there there was a creepy employe the floor was filthy but I got my room in the 5th level of then as I dashed towards the elevator my suite case in hand I entered it then that's where I started to see the beauti of the place the walls where polished wood there was even a small AC / heater unit and it was good . <s> Then out of no where Ting I made it up there this place was great the carpets where velveteen it was a true luxurious hotel I found my rooms and was greeted to a golden door nob I was living in paradise after I got into my room it was a perfect ! <s> The room was a perfect 68 degrees . <s> I was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was ...  perfect ! <s> And it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when I didn't think it could get any better I look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold ! <s> The water actually has a good taste to it like grapes I was so shocked I fell uncontentious I was drowning cause my face fell into the toilet then I woke up you wont believe how fast the assistance will save your life there ! <s> I when t back up into my floor and guess what I say out the windows a swimming pool and it was huge Olympic sized swimming pool It was great . <s> I got on my beach suit and went down there and it was heated over all I don't think I can leave and all of the other swimmers where pretty nice rich people and they where alright though a little big stuck up but not too much . <s> Then came dinner time perfect . <s> I must say I am extremely satisfied with my visit ! <s> Time to fly back to where I cam from and then my plan took off i'm going to miss that hotel 10 / 10 ! <s> Imagine flying to the windy city for business . <s> After a long flight with many delays you get a cab to your hotel ;  the much-hyped Conrad . <s> You've been expecting to fall into a soft bed with a lovely view of the Chicago skyline out your window . <s> That's exactly how I imagined it after my delayed flight and terrible cab ride . <s> That's the opposite of how it turned out . <s> I got in to the lobby late and the person at the counter was busy talking on their cellphone . <s> I approached and they didn't even hang up . <s> They were going on about how they thought the whole Charlie Sheen thing was overblown . <s> I don't care . <s> It's late . <s> I have meetings the next day . <s> I try to check in and they say they can't find my reservation . <s> This is despite the fact I have my receipt with me ! <s> Finally ;  they check me in and don't even bother to have a bellhop help me with my bags . <s> This isn't a cheap room . <s> It's standard to treat your customers with some level of respect . <s> I get to my room and I open the door and it's someone else's room ! <s> Somehow they've given me the wrong room and activated my key for that person's room . <s> Worse yet ;  the occupant was passed out drunk on the bed with his clothes strewn all over the room . <s> I have to carry my bags back downstairs and get checked into the right room . <s> Finally I get up there and my room is missing a pillow . <s> Seriously ? <s> How can the maid not notice . <s> The bed was made . <s> Someone must've been in the room and seen that there was one too few pillows . <s> This episode was exemplary of the rest of my stay . <s> Needless to say ;  neither I nor my business will be using the services of the Conrad in Chicago . <s> I was highly disappointed with my choice to stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago . <s> I had to travel for business at the last minute but felt lucky to get a reservation at such a highly rated hotel . <s> The initial impression was that the desk clerk thought I was lucky that he was waiting on me . <s> I had several questions about local attractions and he acted as though I was bothering him . <s> I was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter . <s> On the plus side the room was lovely ;  but when I called for room service at 9 : 30pm I was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm . <s> I decided to go out rather than fight the issue . <s> The next day the tone was the same at the pool ;  the bar ;  the restaurant etc . <s> The staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do . <s> The only exception was the housekeeping staff . <s> I called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else I needed before leaving . <s> The bottom line is that I booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it . <s> Even though the hotel was beautiful and in a nice location ;  the atmosphere was not inviting . <s> I'd rather go somewhere where I felt like my money was appreciated instead of staying somewhere that didn't seem to care that I was there . <s> Conrad Chicago - After reading the reviews on this hotel ;  I decided to book my stay on last weekend of March this year . <s> For the rate of  $ 245 per night ;  it is a really good value . <s> The deluxe room was Spanning 400 sq . <s> ft .  with complimentary in-room internet access and a king size bed . <s> It had a 42-inch flat-screen television ;  surround sound system ;  iPod alarm clock with charging / docking station ;  in-room electronic safe ;  executive desk and cooling unit . <s> The room also features a bathroom with granite accents ;  glass shower ;  deep soaking bath tub and separate water closet . <s> Very pleasant front staff ;  complimentary breakfast everyday ;  all the 3 dining services in the terrace were exceptional and good wine in the 5th floor lobby . <s> This hotel is situated very close to many sight seeing places of the city . <s> Would certainly recommend this hotel and looking forward to staying here again . <s> i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror . <s> They admitted it was their fault ;  and now they won't pay the  $ 500 to fix it because we can't prove it was not broken before !  !  ! <s> the hotel is wonderful ;  the rooms are new and nice ;  but we will never stay here again because of this .... Be sure to inspect your car before you leave ! <s> My wife and I stayed at the Amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from Norway who were vacationing in the City . <s> We were excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading the reviews here ;  but really disappointed in the accommodations . <s> The web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel . <s> It doesn't state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building . <s> The rest are offices . <s> Our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant . <s> The room itself was unremarkable ;  with standard furnishings equivalent to a Holiday Inn . <s> Although it is close to the best part of the City ;  it is tucked behind the new Trump Tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of road / sidewalk . <s> Our Norwegian friends ;  by contrast ;  stayed on the 33rd floor of Swissotel and had views of the Lake and Navy Pier . <s> Having come to Chicago with my three sisters for a relaxing weekend of shopping and spa days ;  the Hotel Allegro Chicago filled every bit of my checklist . <s> We arrived and immediately were checked in and shown to our rooms ;  we both had the  " double double deluxe "  . <s> The rooms were gorgeous ;  well taken care of ;  clean ;  comfortable ;  well decorated and luxurious . <s> The hotel also has a spa which was perfect because we didn't even have to leave the hotel for our relaxing spa day . <s> The hotel has great staff ;  they were always attentive to our needs . <s> My favorite part was the complimentary tea and cofee - I am a coffee addict and getting my caffeine fix any time of every day was great ! <s> Stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago if you want great service from a relaxing and luxurious hotel in the heart of Chicago's hustle and bustle ! <s> We stayed at the beautiful Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel located in scenic downtown Chicago . <s> It was close to shopping ;  local attractions like the Shedd Aquarium and even the Navy Pier . <s> The hotels featured luxurious amenities like a ball room and in room massages ;  which I took advantage of as any woman  ( or man )  should ! <s> A continental breakfast is available for a nominal fee ;  unless purchased with a package deal ;  in their own upscale restaurant ;  Nix ! <s> We would definitely book a suite there again and highly recommend this hotel to all our friends and family ! <s> My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago . <s> I loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and iPod docking station . <s> I appreciated the walking distance to all of Chicago's premiere shopping areas . <s> The concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations ;  while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service . <s> The services I received at at mySpa were some of the best in the world . <s> Dinner at aria restaurant was delicious . <s> In short ;  Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect luxury vacation ;  meeting all my needs and more ! <s> We stayed at the Palmer House Hilton in early December ;  we stay there that weekend every December and we think it is the best location in the city for us . <s> We like State Street better than Michigan Avenue and the Palmer House is right there . <s> We stayed in the Towers ;  in a room with two double beds and 2 baths . <s> The room was not huge ;  but very comfortable . <s> The towers area was recently refurbished and it shows ;  the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen TVs on the walls ;  comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food / drinks . <s> There is a continental breakfast in the morning ;  appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes . <s> There is a fridge stocked with soft drinks ;  water and juice that are yours for the taking . <s> We were very pleased with the upgraded Towers ;  everyone should check it out ! <s> Extremely disappointed in our stay . <s> This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online . <s> I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be ;  only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for . <s> The room smelled musty and not clean . <s> Garbage was not changed from prior person . <s> Found small ants in bathroom near shower . <s> Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray . <s> Overall this hotel is in a great location ;  but we would never visit again . <s> Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online . <s> IMO the Amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on TA . <s> This is basically a Holiday Inn . <s> Half of the rooms overlook an alley  /  loading dock . <s> The hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am . <s> At 530 ;  when you are just nodding off again ;  they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast . <s> This is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank . <s> Any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise . <s> Reception was a bit tacky and the  " staff "  was a little rough around the edges . <s> I didn't see a single business travellers while I was there . <s> Valet parking was expensive  ( usual for Chicago )  but was very slow . <s> Just ok . <s> Explore other options . <s> Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown- I stayed at this hotel for a long weekend and really enjoyed it . <s> The food was great ;  especially the complimentary breakfast ;  with a great variety of options . <s> The location was perfect for sight seeing in Chicago as the Navy Pier and Michigan Ave was just a short walk away . <s> The staff at the hotel was all extremely friendly and helped me with all my requests ;  including getting extra towels for the bathroom . <s> The room was clean ;  neat ;  and had a nice view of the lake . <s> I would stay here again on my next visit to Chicago . <s> Arrived on 06 / 04 / 05 ;  greeted by friendly doorman ;  and zipped up to the 5th Floor Lobby . <s> Very open lobby area with friendly reception staff . <s> Room was on the 12th Floor and very nice . <s> Everything was in order and very clean ! <s> The king size bed was nice and each night I had a restful sleep . <s> Bathroom was large with separate glass shower stall . <s> The room was furnished with everything I needed including internet hook-up access . <s> Also ;  you can walk thru on the 5th Fl to the Westfield North Bridge Shopping Mall ;  where you will enjoy Nordstrom and other stores . <s> Of course ;  you're steps from Michigan Ave .  too . <s> The central location of the hotel was great ;  as I could walk to most places . <s> The CTA Subway stop  ( Grand Ave .  on Red Line )  was an easy 2 block walk . <s> I will stay here again on my next trip to Chicago ! <s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park - Don't be fooled by the low price and large rooms ;  you can get much better for this price . <s> I booked a room through priceline for  $ 252 a night ;  but they charge for everything . <s> Parking ? <s>  $ 51 / night . <s> Internet ? <s>  $ 15 . 25 / night . <s> It adds up fast . <s> The room wasn't so much bad as it wasn't good . <s> The lobby decor was classy ;  but the room itself was uninspired . <s> It was the same chairs and drapes you see everywhere ;  but a bit worse for the wear . <s> The coffee table by the bed was wobbly  ( enough that you wouldnâ€™t want to set a drink down on it )  ;  and the couch under the window was lacking cushioning  ( it felt like you were sitting on a wood beam )  . <s> Annoyingly ;  you can hear your neighbors through the walls . <s> I had a wonderful time at the James Hotel while on business in Chicago . <s> The rooms are modern ;  tasteful and well-kept ;  while the staff was responsive and efficient . <s> This was the perfect place to unwind after working all day ;  but also provided an ideal atmosphere to do some more work . <s> The Hyatt Regency in Chicago was a wonderful experience for my husband and I as we traveled through the area on vacation . <s> After checking in we simply relaxed in the beautiful atrium for a while before going to our room . <s> To our delight the room was very clean ;  ultra-modern and furnished with sleek and comfortable furniture . <s> What really impressed us about the room was how spacious it was and the stunning river front views . <s> We were pressed for time to make dinner so decided the Bistro sounded like the best option and it turned out to be a great choice ! <s> The food was simply fabulous . <s> After dinner we were able to try out the fitness center ;  which ended up making our gym at home seem inadequate . <s> This was just what we needed as a restful base for our Chicago vacation and we will definitely stay here again . <s> We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7 / 24 / 09 . <s> We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only  $ 69  ( normal rate was around  $ 200 )  . <s> The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . <s> Hotel is only about 1 . 5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . <s> Parking is very expensive at  $ 50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just  $ 30 . <s> We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . <s> We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . <s> They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . <s> Glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . <s> I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit . <s> This hotel was magnificent ! <s> Not only was it a mini palace ;  but the staff was polite ;  helpful ;  and professional . <s> In an e-mail I received before we left for Chicago ;  the concierge ;  Les ;  offered to get us tickets ;  directions ;  reservations to anything we'd like to see / do . <s> He also got us an upgrade on our room ;  and when someone rudely butted in line as we were registering ;  the registry person said they would upgrade our room just for that . <s> And so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and jacuzzi . <s> The bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning ! <s> I loved staying at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ;  not only is it an amazingly friendly atmosphere ;  but they give me the option to bring my pet with me . <s> They are a dog friendly hotel ;  it costs  $ 55 . 00 a night for the dog to stay with you ;  but that beats the costs of paying a kennel to keep or your dog or a neighbor to watch them for you . <s> I loved this option . <s> They also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats ;  food ;  bowls and doggy clean up bags . <s> I higly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for a place to bring your four-legged friend with you when you travel . <s> Spent two nights at the InterContinental on a business trip . <s> This is a tremendous ;  towering hotel in one of the best locations in Chicago  --  right on the Magnificent Mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area . <s> My room was in the Historic Tower  --  a 1920s Masonic Club which has been converted at enormous expense . <s> The effort has been worthwhile . <s> My room was very large and well furnished ;  with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle . <s> It had breathtaking views down Michigan Avenue . <s> There is a superb recreation centre  ( with an impressive swimming pool )  beautiful bars and a good restaurant ;  Zest ;  that serves a great breakfast . <s> There is wifi in the rooms  (  $ 9 . 95 per day )  and tea and coffee making facilities . <s> No trouser press ;  but there is an ironing board and iron . <s> The staff is friendly and anxious to please . <s> I recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms . <s> It's expensive ;  but it will be difficult to find a better one in Chicago . <s> I really had high hopes for Homewood Suites when I stayed there on a week-long business trip last month . <s> After all ;  considering their prices  ( it's technically a Hilton )  ;  you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel . <s> I'll start with the good stuff about the hotel :  it's in downtown . <s> Now for the bad stuff :  first ;  everyone is rude . <s> I'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp . <s> The bellboy scowled at me in the lobby ;  was rough with my luggage ;  and then scowled at me again when I tipped him  $ 5 . <s> Likewise ;  the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head . <s> She had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in ;  and I had a reservation ! <s> Apparently she was new ;  and didn't have much experience using the computer ;  but that's no excuse :  it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium . <s> Sadly ;  the room was no better than the service . <s> The hot water in the sink did not work ;  the shower was only lukewarm ;  and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink . <s> Complimentary mood lighting ;  I guess . <s> The TV was a bust ;  sure it was an LCD ;  but the ESPN logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel . <s> And to top it all off ;  the bed smelled funny . <s> I called the front desk  ( at least the phone worked )  ;  and asked for fresh sheets . <s> The person I talked to said they'd be right up ;  but never came . <s> Eventually ;  I gave up . <s> I woke up the next morning to back pain  ( the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow )  . <s> I left the room ;  and made my way through the chilly hallways to the  " complimentary buffet . <s>  "  Literally all the food was bad . <s> Even the cereal tasted stale . <s> Looking around ;  everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience . <s> The sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel . <s> Just plain sad . <s> Worst part was ;  it was the same thing for the next four days ;  too . <s> During my stay at the Hilton Chicago it has been quite unpleasant . <s> How so you might ask ? <s> Well ill tell you ;  the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible I mean they weren't even at the desk when I checked in . <s> Also ;  When I ordered my breakfast ;  lunch ;  and dinner from room service I received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch . <s> Finally ;  The bill was charging me for stuff I didn't want or ask for . <s> But overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others . <s> I give it a half a star . <s> I will never use Ambassador East Hotel again . <s> The first appearance you get is a very dark and dreary type setting . <s> The exterior of the hotel was in desperate need of repair . <s> The customer service was not as good as you would expect when spending your hard earned money on a hotel room . <s> In this hotel you are spending more than the average amount of money on a room that is smaller than the average hotel room . <s> I felt rushed out at check out and didn't have an enjoyable experience at all . <s> Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park - My stay at Fairmont during my last visit was not a pleasing one . <s> This was the place where furniture goes before anything else . <s> The only good thing about hotel was its good location . <s> The wallpaper was coming off the wall . <s> The table lamp in our room had no bulb in it . <s> When we called room service to get us one ;  we had to wait for half an hour before we finally got some light in the room . <s> The service stinks and so do the rooms . <s> I am NEVER EVER going back to this place . <s> Recently staying at the Omni Chicago Hotel ;  was a waste of money . <s> The rooms are typical standard rooms ;  ( unless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms )  ;  the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless ;  your ideal ;  idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room . <s> Sorry to say in short I think my money would have been better spent staying at a HoJo's . <s> I recently stayed at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago ;  and it was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a high-end hotel . <s> I was in Chicago for a conference ;  and I thought I would enjoy the experience more if I had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to ;  but this hotel definitely wasn't that place . <s> The restaurants were mediocre at best ;  despite their high prices ;  I repeatedly got food that was bland ;  overcooked ;  or lukewarm . <s> The room was fine ;  but nothing special ;  I think I'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown Chicago . <s> A big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel ;  though ;  was with their Jet Set Pets program ;  it's hard to find a decent ;  relaxing hotel that I'll like that will also accept my dog . <s> But many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt ;  who is energetic and loves people but isn't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he's got that terrier look . <s> Multiple people mocked him ;  or said there was no point grooming him ;  or asked why I wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room . <s> I know that it's a fairly high-end hotel ;  but I would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs . <s> I hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well . <s> The experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory ;  especially for the price . <s> I can give them good marks on their spa services ;  and I really appreciated the pillow  " menu ;  "  but other than that it didn't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience ;  especially given the customer service . <s> We got a great deal on this hotel ;  just  $ 91 found through travelzoo . <s> We only stayed one night ;  but were very impressed . <s> The sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property . <s> The hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate . <s> Our room ;  while not enormous was perfect . <s> We had a great view of the city and lake . <s> The bed was extremely comfortable . <s> We never heard any noise outside of our room . <s> The bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel ;  two could get ready very comfortably . <s> Location was perfect ;  just off Michigan Ave and steps away from Millenium Park . <s> We would definetly stay here again ;  especially if we could get this great deal ! <s> Not worth the price ! <s> I had the unfortunate experience of staying in the Hilton Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago . <s> I stayed there with my family while we were on vacation . <s> I wish I would have saved my money and went somewhere else . <s> With a hotel this expensive ;  you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way ;  like complimentary parking . <s> Not a chance . <s> In addition to the  $ 259 price tag ;  I also had to pay  $ 30 for parking ;  per night . <s> If I had stayed at the Motel 6 ;  parking would have been free . <s> The staff there were not very nice at all . <s> When I registered ;  the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time . <s> She was very rude to me . <s> Perhaps she was having a bad day or something ;  but I doubt it . <s> After I arrived in my room ;  my key card didn't work ;  and I had to go back downstairs to get it fixed  ( once again ;  interrupting her precious free time with some actual work )  . <s> The rooms had some nice features ;  like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television . <s> I didn't go on vacation to cook though . <s> The television didn't get very many channels ;  and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies  ( of course )  . <s> I tried logging into Facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room ;  but the  " complimentary "  internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using . <s> I get a better connection at Starbucks . <s> They offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast ;  but it's nothing to write home about . <s> I've had better food at McDonald's . <s> The food was pretty cold ;  and the choices are very limited . <s> Traffic around the hotel was hideous . <s> This hotel is downtown ;  and you can definitely tell . <s> There are a bunch of one-way streets around ;  which makes getting in and out confusing . <s> The room was pretty clean ;  but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges . <s> If you're looking for a hotel in Chicago ;  I'd say save some money and go somewhere else . <s> I've had better stays at the Best Western and many other hotels that cost less . <s> We planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip . <s> I booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite ;  then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff . <s> Well ;  our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly ;  and thankfully ;  switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights . <s> The room was dirty . <s> When we opened the sofabed ;  the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out . <s> Ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used ;  and theoretically cleaned ;  a lot . <s> Extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better . <s> Temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night ;  it made for a cold stay . <s> If you like to eat for free  ( they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights )  and don't care to eat the great food Chicago has to offer ;  I guess some may find this place tolerable . <s> But we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a Golden Corral . <s> The only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area  ( we switched to The James and had a great experience )  . <s> I couldn't be paid to stay here again . <s> I'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience . <s> If you have not tried the Millennium Knickerbocker for a stay in Chicago ;  do it now ! <s> We have stayed  ( and enjoyed )  at the Drake ;  Intercontinental and others ;  but we always now come back to the Knickerbocker . <s> Why ? <s> If  " Charlie "  the doorman is on duty and you pull up ;  he will welcome you . <s> He'll probably ask your name . <s> Why ? <s> Because he wants to call you by your name every time he will see you during your visit . <s> Somehow he even lets the other employees know your name and all of a sudden ;  doorman ;  receptionist ;  bellman ;  waiter are referring to you by name . <s> The employees are what makes this hotel . <s> Yes ;  it has everything to offer like all hotels ;  but the others don't have the fine people  ( including the cleaning staff )  these folks have . <s> Try it ;  you will like it . <s> We look forward to our next visit already ...  <s> I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago during Labor day weekend ;  huge mistake ! <s> When I got to my room everything seemed okay ; Until I went into the bathroom . <s> There was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard I turned the knob ;  it would not stop . <s> There was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper . <s> It also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as I saw a wad of hair ;  and scraps of tissue behind the bowl . <s> I called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it . <s> While I was waiting I turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there ....  the a . c .  started blowing out hot ;  musky air and had the room smelling horrible . <s> I made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room . <s> They told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator . <s> I was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip I was hearing I had no choice but to take it . <s> When I moved to the new room ;  there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on . <s> Front desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later ;  I was able to relax and settle in . <s> Hard Rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason ;  I will not be staying there again . <s> Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park - I attended a conference held at this hotel and also stayed here for 3 nights . <s> If you're going to be stuck in a hotel for a few days ;  this one is not too shabby . <s> Clean ;  spacious rooms ;  bathrooms don't feel cramped ;  and the bed -- -pretty comfortable . <s> I slept really well and woke up easily to a very bright room . <s> I love big windows and morning light ;  and my corner room had all of these . <s> I only wish the hotel had a pool because I missed my late-night swims . <s> Otherwise ;  can't complain . <s> Good location ;  prompt service and nice decor . <s> I recommend a room on a higher floor ;  it's quieter and has better views . <s> DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL ! <s> I made my reservation early and got there on time ;  but the receptionist claimed that my room was occupied ! <s> I guess it was some kind of glitch in the system ;  but for a frequent business traveller like me this is absolutely unacceptable . <s> I argued with the receptionist for a good half-hour and finally she was able to bring up my original reservation . <s> Despite this ;  it took me another half-hour to convince her  ( and the manager ! <s>  )  to give me a different room ;  since I had nowhere else to stay . <s> Finally ;  I get a key to a room they had on reserve  ( I guess that's how this whole thing started ;  huh ! <s>  )  So I make my way to the 5th floor . <s> I find what is supposed to be my new room . <s> I open the door . <s> Get on the floor . <s> Everybody do the dinosaur . <s> Allegro Chicago - First off ;  I'd like to say that the Allegro is a fine hotel and you wouldn't be doing wrong by staying there . <s> However ;  with all the great hotels in the Chicago area ;  you could certainly do better . <s> The Allegro has all the amenities you'd expect from a 4 star hotel ;  and the price is nice ;  but as they say  " The devil is in the details "  and its these details that Allegro fails to measure up to its competitors in . <s> First of all ;  the Allegro doesn't provide an airport shuttle ;  which is a convenience a tourist really shouldn't have to do without ;  especially at a 4 star hotel . <s> I stayed in a King Premier room and while the room itself was of decent size ;  the bathroom was quite small . <s> I also didn't like the blue and gold decor theme they had going on ;  but that really is just personal taste . <s> To be fair ;  my stay there was pleasant ;  and really a hotel mainly exists to serve as a place to rest when visiting somewhere ;  but for around the same amount of money ;  you could do much better . <s> We booked this hotel using points on our credit card . <s> When we arrived ;  we were immediately greeted by a friendly face . <s> We arrived several hours before check-in . <s> However ;  they let us check-in early . <s> They also gave us a free room upgrade . <s> The hotel is absolutely stunning ! <s> In addition ;  it is off of State Street . <s> There are many things to do - shopping ;  dinning ;  theater . <s> It is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the United Center or the airport . <s> The hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge . <s> The room was so dark and quiet we slept in . <s> The Hilton Chicago was amazing !  ! <s> It is close to almost everything that Chicago has to offer ! <s> We could walk to Lake Michigan ;  Grant Park ;  Niketown ;  Watertower place ;  etc . <s> The rooms were very nice and refreshed every day . <s> Also ;  they allow pets !  ! <s> You don't have to go far to get good food because they have a few different restaurants right there ! <s> Overall experience was an A++ . <s> The atmosphere at the Talbott Hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in . <s> The employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive . <s> The hotel seems to be luxurious ;  even from the lobby ;  and right away ;  I was very excited for my stay ! <s> I stayed in a double queen room with my friend . <s> The room is spacious enough ;  and beds are very comfortable . <s> I didn't try the room service ;  but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa ;  which is very convenient . <s> I also love how the room has individual climate controls ! <s> Very neat ! <s> Also handy that there is an iHome in the room . <s> I'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels . <s> I will most likely stay in this hotel another time . <s> It was a wonderful experience ! <s> I have to agree that the InterContinental Chicago is a nice hotel from the outside . <s> But it is not a nice place to stay if you are planning to visit Chicago . <s> The ambience of the hotel looks bland and they also have the same amenities as other cheaper hotels . <s> You can get an excellent dining experience somewhere for less . <s> This hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years . <s> The first room they gave us was a shock . <s> TINY and the bathroom was a joke ;  ;  you had to step inside ;  move out of the way just to shut the door . <s> The furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was VERY beat up and painted over about 100 times . <s> so they transfered us to the 'executive suite' That room had a tiny bathroom .. <s> I mean TINY ! <s> The furniture was hideous and dirty . <s> It was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud . <s> The only impressive part is the lobby ..  but don't be fooled . <s> because after that  ..  the floors above look like they need a major overhaul ..  and the rooms were not worth even  $ 100 per night . <s> we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through Priceline deal . <s> I don't think we want to do Priceline again only because they have the Knickerbocker as a 4 star Hotel and we don't ever want to go back there again . <s> 2 Stars at best for the dumpy Knickerbocker . <s> They should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms . <s> Boomer . <s> Naperville ;  IL <s> The Hilton Chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel . <s> There are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from King with two bathrooms ;  Lakeside view or suites . <s> It only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill . <s> You will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return ! <s> The staff is nice but when I stay at a hotel I do not go out of my way to seek out the staff . <s> The casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap . <s> Next time I stay in Chicago I will be looking elsewhere . <s> I have stayed at the James a few times ;  it is my go to hotel in Chicago . <s> This last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options . <s> The Good :  Location is awesome ;  just off Michigan Ave ;  Trader Joe's across street for some healthier snacking . <s> It is a great location ;  easy to walk most anywhere . <s> The door staff are very friendly and helpful . <s> The overall feeling is modern ;  upbeat . <s> Turn down service with cookie is nice . <s> Free Wifi  ( which worked to varying degrees throughout stay )  The Bad :  They claim to be a 4 . 5 star hotel ;  which to me ;  means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star  ( without a pool )  . <s> They used to have Kiehls toiletries and now have  " Harmony "  brand . <s> Additionally ;  they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you . <s> It is what I would expect from Holiday Inn or my gym ;  but not a 4 . 5 star hotel . <s> I asked about the switch  ( mainly because when I booked they still had Kiehls in website description )  and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be  " green "  . <s> That is hard to believe ;  as it's not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green  ( they still have incandescent light bulbs ;  housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down ;  they don't recycle in room ;  etc )  . <s> They are obviously trying to cut costs ;  and it shows . <s> More :  the rooms are in need of some updating ;  they are looking somewhat tired . <s> My third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front  ( not their fault )  . <s> Don't take the stairs  ( as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie )  ;  even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile . <s> The phone staff was fairly rude  ( granted ;  they didn't like me questioning their toiletry change )  . <s> I feel bad giving such a low rating ;  but it really did not come close to my expectations  ( from previous stays there )  . <s> I will start trying out new hotels in the area . <s> This hotel was everything we were looking for . <s> My mom and I were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out . <s> The Talbott Hotel was incredible . <s> The rooms were very clean and spacious and had everything we needed . <s> The hotel check in was easy and the guest services folks were awesome ! <s> They even gave us tips on great restaurants in the area . <s> Highly recommend this hotel on your next trip to chicago ! <s> The location was good . <s> Check-in was ok . <s> Asked for non smoking room ;  given floor with half smoking half non smoking . <s> We could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened . <s> We asked for and recieved a room on a non-smoking floor . <s> They did not bring up the key ;  we had to go down to the lobby to get it . <s> Breakfast could have had some healthy choices ;  the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh . <s> Bananas not ripe . <s> Room only had ONE wash cloth ;  had to call down for more . <s> Housekeeping NEVER showed up at our room . <s> Not for turndown service  ;  not for the morning clean -up . <s> Called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the Do Not Disturb sign . <s> They said they would come up and they never came when they said they would . <s> We finally told them not to come because of the time . <s> We wanted to get ready to go out for dinner . <s> Never greeted by anyone as we came and went . <s> I have stayed at the Peninsula and the Burnham . <s> The Burnham was booked during our stay or I would have stayed there . I will NEVER stay at this hotel again ;  Not worth 300 . 00 a night <s> My husband and I arrived at the Swissotel Chicago to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary . <s> We automatically thought our experience would be nice because the pictures on the website and the hotel's brochure intrigued us . <s> Boy were wee wrong ! <s> Upon arrival  ( at the given and advertised check-in time )  our room was not ready . <s> We waited for more than an hour ;  with our bags in hand . <s> We checked more than twice to see if the room was ready ;  but the staff was less than  " warm "  both times . <s> After a few frowns and mumbles from the people at the desk in the hotels' lobby ;  tired and finally arriving to our room ;  we expected to take a nap and hit the city . <s> We reserved the premier Corner King or so we thought . <s> We were supposed to be able to see the lakes and rivers and the skyline . <s> Yeah ;  right ! <s> All we saw were the brick side of the other side of the building . <s> In addition ;  the water in the shower had little pressure . <s> We called the front desk ;  the phone rang for 21 times before someone answered . <s> My husband said that he thinks that they knew we were the people calling . <s> We requested a better room ;  but they said that none was available . <s> However ;  they did have an upgraded room ;  but we would have to pay some sort of upgrade fee . <s> We could not believe it . <s> My husband felt that we should not  " agitate "  them any further ;  for fear that they might make things even worse for us :  like turn off our air . <s> We threw on some more jeans and headed fro the coffee shop around the corner that had given us refuge before . <s> After returning about 2 hours later ;  the water pressure was fixed . <s> The room was clean and the bed was plush ;  but the overall experience  ( especially the rudeness of the staff )  was not good . <s> Let's just say that on our next 13th anniversary we won't stay at the Swissotel and will tell others to not stay there . <s> I checked in at the Affinia Hotel in Chicago shortly after dinner on Tuesday ;  I was greeted by very frendly staff from the valet service to front desk . <s> You can tell people were happy at the hotel . <s> I was pleasantly surprised when I got to my room . <s> The room was very well decorated and well thought out . <s> The furniture was in the right location and there was lots of space . <s> Plus it was convenient with lots of power outlets The bedroom and washroom was very clean and I had a great sleep in their very comfortable bed . <s> I was told by front desk i could choose from 6 different pillows ;  although i did not take advantage of this offer i thought what a great idea . <s> Once in a while you come across hotels with great service ;  well thought out rooms in a perfect location  ( right off Magnificent Mile )  . <s> When visiting Chicago again I will definitely try and stay at Affinia again <s> My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory . <s> I would have expected much for from such a  " high end "  hotel . <s> The rooms were way over priced ;  and the service was less than satisfactory . <s> At one point ;  I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up ;  and when room service came through ;  they were still there ! <s> On the other side of things ;  the cup I had left on my desk  ( which I was planning to use later )  was gone . <s> My coffee and my towels were also never replaced . <s> I also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room . <s> Rather ;  it was a  " nominal fee "  . <s> After paying so much for a room ;  I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi . <s> My stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for . <s> I will not be staying there again . <s> amalfihotelchicago - My family and I stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago recently and we absolutely LOVED it  !  ! <s> Everything from the big flat screen TV in the room to the comfortable bedsheets and steam shower made it a wonderful stay . <s> There was a fully equipped gym that me and husband used everyday while the kids spent a lot of their time playing the pool . <s> Overall it was a great stay and I strongly recommend others to stay here as well ! <s> This hotel has a good name and a good location in Chicago . <s> Unfortunately I was very unsatisfied with this hotel . <s> This is a luxury hotel ;  so you are paying luxury prices . <s> So ;  I expect to get my money's worth . <s> Unfortunately that was not the case at the InterContinental . <s> Firstly ;  my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture . <s> Again ;  this is supposed to be a luxury hotel ;  and it's expensive . <s> I shouldn't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty . <s> I also had trouble getting the room to the temperature I wanted . <s> I'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it's a problem in the whole hotel . <s> The building is old and I suppose it has a lot of problems from being old . <s> Secondly ;  I was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel's staff . <s> I thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive . <s> Thirdly ;  this hotel has a lot of additional expenses . <s> I felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got  ( use of the fitness amenities ;  internet ;  etc )  . <s> When I'm already paying so much for a hotel room ;  I get very irritated when I feel I'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get . <s> This hotel has a nice looking building ;  and again ;  it's in a terrific location . <s> But I really don't think it's worth the expense . <s> There are so many other hotels in Chicago to choose from that are so much better . <s> Staying at the Sofitel was one of the less pleasurable experiences I have had in Chicago . <s> Upon entering ;  there was no one offered to take my luggage so I was forced to carry it up to the check in desk . <s> The front desk staff was not friendly or welcoming . <s> The room was smaller than I expected and smelled of fake suede . <s> I decided to have drink and some food in Le Bar and upon entering ;  I immediately noticed how dimly lit the room was . <s> I could barely see the bartenders face . <s> The drinks were alright and the food was sub-par compared to what I was expecting . <s> After an hour ;  I was ready for bed so I returned to my room to lay down . <s> The mattress was surprising stiff . <s> The noise was higher than expected as well . <s> Thankfully ;  it was only a one night stay . <s> We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year's in 2008 just to get away for a few days . <s> We found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap . <s> So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again . <s> It also included parking at the great price . <s> Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago . <s> Best location to walk EVERYWHERE . <s> My 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows . <s> Can't wait to go back . <s> I recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to attend a corporate meeting . <s> To say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement . <s> I stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels . <s> My room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style . <s> A fully stocked refreshment center ;  wet bar ;  and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items . <s> The Allegro is in the center of everything ;  the Chicago Loop of the financial district ;  the Chicago Theatre district ;  great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel  ( I suggest the 312 Lunch Club )  . <s> The fitness room is well equipped and clean . <s> The professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the Allegro . <s> My next visit to the Chicago area will definitely include a stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago . <s> so my sweetie lures me out under the guise of dinner at the China Grill ;  upon arrival he tells me his boys are watching the game in a suite upstairs and want to say hi ... we arrive at the 35th floor and my oh my !  !  ! <s> SURPRISE !  !  ! <s> ladies and gentlemen THIS is something to be admired ... spacious and roomy ;  yet warm ;  cozy and inviting ... great bed ;  comfortable furniture ;  great 42 inch plasmas ;  and the views are UNBELIEVABLE ... my only complaint ? <s> a shower should have a door to keep the heat IN ... other than that no complaints ;  room service was great ;  morning coffee was yummo ... overall a fabulous experience !  !  ! <s> Hotel Allegro - My boyfriend and I recently convened in Chicago for our 6 year anniversary ;  we decided to stay at Hotel Allegro and it was the best decision we could have made . <s> They welcomed us with open arms ;  and their rooms were huge with very clean sheets . <s> We were able to eat at 312 Chicago ;  which is an Italian restaurant with to die for Ravioli . <s> We booked our stay with the No Taxation without Libations promotion ;  so we were able to have cocktails and a meal in the Encore Liquid Lounge for a GREAT value . <s> All in all the staff gave us the five star treatment we were not expecting ;  due to our young age ;  and I will definitely be returning to this hotel . <s> I travel often and whenever I travel I prefer to stay at Hilton properties . <s> I am always satisfied with my stay at Hilton . <s> locations . <s> However ;  I have never stayed at a Homewood Suites location . <s> This property was awesome and it was great to have the same satisfication when I arrived . <s> The lobby area was excellent and the greeting from the front desk staff was wonderful ! <s> My room was in great condition ! <s> Absolutely no complaints . <s> I just figured that a property like this should be recognized . <s> Great job staff !  !  !  ! <s> I will definitely return in the future ! <s> I love the Ambassador East ;  true ;  she's a little old but she's a classic treasure . <s> The service is wonderful ;  from the minute you arrive you are greeted warmly and with a nice welcome ! <s> I felt the service was good ;  room was clean and quiet and that all the staff was very accomodating . <s> The biggest gem is the Pump Room bar and restaurant . <s> The best drinks ;  amazing food ;  exciting photographs and fun music on the weekends . <s> This is set in the most fabulous location ;  historical neightborhood ;  close to walk the lakefront ;  well known hometown bars ;  excellent restaurants Chicago has to offer and most of all shopping . <s> There was a nice street market going on over the summer-fall weekends ;  giving this area a real interesting flavor of Chicago . <s> I can see it needs some updating but I was totally happy and content with my stay . <s> I travel a great deal in my work and have seen all kinds of hotels . <s> I will stay here again in the future . <s> We decided to spend a little extra to stay at this hotel while visiting our son in Chicago . <s> Won't make that mistake again . <s> The rooms are smaller than they appear on the web  ( creative photography )  and the place is dirty . We've stayed at Best Westerns that are cleaner ! <s> The air conditioner is super loud  ...  and the walls are paper thin . <s> The people in the next room must have been having a party and despite three calls to the front desk between 1 and 3 a . m .  ;  Security failed to stop the ruckus . <s> Also thought the front desk staff was rude . <s> Usually in Hyatts ;  Hiltons ;  etc . <s>  ;  the staff is polite and tries to be accommodating . <s> These people weren't particularly personable  ...  we seemed to be an interruption of their work rather than the reason for it . <s> The only positive about the hotel was the location  --  but that doesn't make up for the negative experience . <s> Save some money and stay somewhere else ! <s> This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete . <s> The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 5 : 30am and goes on into the night . <s> Dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 24 / 7 . <s> Worst of all ;  the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating . <s> Ugh ! <s> My husband and I arrived for a 3 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary . <s> We had booked an Executive Guest room ;  upon arrival we were informed that they would be upgrading us to a beautiful Junior Suite . <s> This was just a wonderful unexpected plus to our beautifully planned weekend . <s> The front desk manager was professional and made us feel warmly welcomed . <s> The Chicago Affinia was just a gorgeous hotel ;  friendly staff ;  lovely food and great atmosphere . <s> Not the mention the feather pillows and bedding that was just fantastic . <s> Also we were allowed to bring out beloved Shi-Tzu and he experienced the Jet Set Pets stay . <s> The grooming was perfect ;  the daycare service we felt completely comfortable with . <s> This was a beautiful weekend ;  thank you Affinia Hotels ! <s> We would visit this hotel again ! <s> homewood suites chicago - Nice hotel . <s> I paid about  $ 300 / night for the weekend . <s> My room was large and comfortable ;  and a breakfast buffet was included ;  which helped offset the pricey room There's supposed to be a free dinner included too ;  but it only runs on the weekdays ;  so I never got to try it . <s> If you're staying through the week that may help justify the price ;  too . <s> My only complaint was the noise during the night ;  but I suppose there's only so much you can do in a big city . <s> If I ever have to go back to Chicago ;  I'd definitely consider staying there again . <s> Just got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker . <s> Went up to Chicago for some last minute Christmas shopping . <s> Hotel is in a great location . <s> North end of Michigan Ave .  about half a block away . <s> Staff was very nice and professional . <s> Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful . <s> Granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets . <s> We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room . <s> Good size room ;  with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed . <s> Bathroom was somewhat small . <s> Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day . <s> Did not eat at the restaurant Nix ;  but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar . <s> Overheard comments saying the food was very good . <s> Drink service at the Martini Bar can be slow . <s> Martinis run  $ 9 and up . <s> Very good drinks and they don't shy away from the liquor . <s> Valet parking was  $ 35 a day with in / out priviliges . <s> Overall a great stay . <s> Would definately stay at this hotel in the future . <s> There are many high-quality hotels in Chicago . <s> There are many high-quality hotels on the magnificent mile and then there is the Affinia Chicago . <s> With its neo-classical stylings and its non-classical service ;  it is just a combination for trouble ;  We had established our reservations for Friday the 15th amd arrived at 4pm to check-in . <s> No Room . <s> One hour after their posted check in time and nothing . <s> No apology ;  no offer for upgrade ;  no discount . <s> Nothing . <s> As a seasoned traveler I have had my share of disappointments but this tops the list . <s> I traveled to Chicago with my husband for a romantic weekend away . <s> Our stay at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower could not have been more luxurious ! <s> Our room had anything you could ever want ;  a mini bar ;  air conditioning . <s> We were also within walking distance of many sites and fun restaurants . <s> The staff was friendly ;  and the beds were like clouds . <s> Overall ; the experience was worth every penny . <s> The hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly ;  however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking . <s> Our air conditioning didn't seem to be working well ;  but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually ...  cool off . <s> Our first night was interrupted by a phone call at one A . M .  That was a fax ;  it happened 4 times . <s> By this time we realized that the air was not working again ;  so after fussing with the controls it did kick on . <s> The next morning I mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone ;  but didn't think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working . <s> After being out seeing the sites of Chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show  . <s> Our room was 78 degrees ;  I called and maintenience did come to check . <s> After determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out . <s> I feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel . <s> Also was very surprised that WiFi was not a free service  !  ! <s> We will not be staying at the Hilton on our next trip to Chicago . <s> My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend . <s> The hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive . <s> The concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay ;  and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do . <s> We were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel ;  the lobby ;  dining areas ;  and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury . <s> The decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white ;  and lighting that complimented and set the mood . <s> The bar and lounge areas had excellent service ;  and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown Chicago . <s> Additionally ;  my husband and I were extra pleased to learn that because we are AAA members ;  we would be receiving 20 %  off our room rate for the weekend . <s> Overall ;  the amenities and experience of staying at the Hotel Allegro Chicago made us feel like movie stars ;  pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment ;  one in which we would definitely choose to stay again . <s> Stayed at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park and it was not a good experience . <s> The room had been cleaned in a haphazardly fashion and was not pleasant to walk into . <s> When I called the service desk for more towels to be brought up into the room ;  it took an exceedingly long amount of time for them to be brought up ;  and the woman who delivered the towels was as rude as can be . <s> Will not be staying at Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park again . <s> Our stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant . <s> We enjoyed the location . <s> We could easily walk to the Red line or access the bus lines along Michigan Avenue . <s> We felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and viewing the fabulous architecture that is on N .  State Street and Dearborn . <s> We walked to 3rd Coast Cafe ;  the Chicago History Museum ;  and Second City from our hotel . <s> Our room was spacious and well-kept ;  and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening . <s> We would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown . <s> We definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place . <s> The Omni is in a fabulous location on Michigan Avenue . <s> Within just blocks are all types of stores ;  including Saks ;  Nordstroms ;  H & M ;  Filenes Basement ;  Macys ;  La Perla ;  Apple ;  Bloomingdates ..... I could go on and on ! <s> The room itself was fabulous . <s> Comfortable ;  nice big flat screen tvs ;  nice sized bathroom . <s> They charge for Wi-Fi ;  but we found if we clicked yes on joining their guest program we could then go from the sign-on screen right to our email without actually completing the registration . <s> We got this hotel for  $ 214 / night through Priceline and felt it was a terrific deal ! <s> We really enjoyed our stay at the Palmer House Hilton . <s> We were in Chicago for a weekend stay ;  and wanted something close to State Street ;  and convenient to the theatre district and the museums ;  and Michigan Ave .  shopping . <s> This is a grand old hotel ;  with just about every amenity one could wish for . <s> The lobby is fabulous ;  and the hotel also has some nice restaurants  . <s> Our room had a nice king sized bed ;  and was pretty cozy . <s> Hotel employees were very nice and helpful to us . <s> I would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a  " grand hotel "  type experience at a reasonable price for the many amenities and in a very convenient spot in downtown Chicago . <s> You will definitely feel special . <s> If you are traveling anywhere near Lake Michigan within the next year or less ;  I would highly recommend staying at The Sofitel Hotel . <s> Unbeatable elegance ;  fine dining ;  and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of . <s> Along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest . <s> If there were such a thing as a 10 star rating ;  The Sofitel would surely have it . <s> My visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort . <s> Located minutes from everything in downtown Chicago ;  one would hardly want to leave . <s> Fine dining ;  dancing ;  and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting ;  or social event in town . <s> The Sofitel Hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave . <s> I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on a recent trip to Chicago ;  and had a great stay . <s> The rooms were beautiful ;  the beds comfortable ;  and the views of the city were fantastic . <s> My room overlooked the river and the city . <s> I felt like I was on a luxury vacation . <s> The hotel has a few different restaurants . <s> I ate at the Chicago Burger Company ;  which was delicious . <s> The burgers were juicy ;  and the prices were great . <s> The indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities . <s> Overall ;  I had a wonderful stay . <s> My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad ;  unfortunately ;  we would never stay in this hotel again . <s> The rooms looked nice ;  but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . <s> The room service cost was super high - costing us over  $ 100 for 1 burger ;  1 order of french toast ;  2 pops and 2 desserts . <s> In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake . <s> We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room  ( we were on the 5th floor ;  same as the reception desk )  . <s> They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . <s> The staff was friendly enough ;  but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . <s> There was not even a coffee pot in the room . <s> Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . <s> NOT worth it ! <s> I recently stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for two night ;  and my visit was nothing short of disappointing . <s> Expecting to have a wonderfully romantic weekend with my fiance ;  we specifically chose this hotel because we prefer boutique hotels for the extra attention from the staff and unique atmosphere . <s> Our expectations for the Ambassador were not met . <s> The room was small and ;  frankly ;  outdated . <s> The bathroom smelled musty . <s> The A / C in the room had two settings :  polar cold or off . <s> The walls did nothing to muffle sound from adjacent rooms ;  and it was loud at night - a good night's sleep was impossible . <s> Staff were indifferent . <s> Do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel . <s> Frankly ;  it's not worth the steep price and mediocre character . <s> Since there are far better and more accommodating boutique hotels in Chicago ;  I know I won't be back at this place . <s> We booked this trip several months in advance and were greatly looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Monaco in Chicago . <s> However ;  our experience was significantly different from what we expected ;  for the following reasons . <s> First of all ;  there was only one person at the front desk when we arrived . <s> That person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes . <s> Then when we got to our room ;  there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but I found them to be incredibly dusty . <s> Just bumping into them slightly caused a cloud of dust to emerge which I found distasteful . <s> Overall it was a good stay but those two inconveniences made us question the amount of money we paid for it . <s> I recently stayed at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago in Chicago ;  Illinois . <s> I must say ;  that staying at this hotel is like staying at a high end hotel for celebrities . <s> There are spa packages ;  room service ;  and the hotel is decorated extremely beautifully . <s> I would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to be treated like a star . <s> They take reservations ;  and also have a great restaurant right inside of the building . <s> Whatever you need ;  they will accommodate you . <s> This is heaven on earth ! <s> I would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel ;  even if its for one day ;  its worth it . <s> This is an absolutely exquisite hotel ;  at a great location ;  and boasting superb amenities . <s> I was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on Michigan Ave . <s> The hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk . <s> I appreciated the homey ;  well-designed interior and views of the city . <s> It was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so I didn't have to wander the city for my late night meal . <s> This will definitely be my hotel of choice when I return to the city . <s> I was really excited about staying at the Amalfi after reading several reviews online . <s> Unfortunately ;  it was a very disappointing experience . <s> When we arrived ;  we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold . <s> So ;  we had to move to another hotel . <s> Amalfi did take care of the other hotel ;  cab fare ;  and after much negotiating ... breakfast . <s> We were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient . <s> Instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned ;  we had to get up ;  pack up our suitcases ;  check out of the hotel ;  take a cab ;  check back into the Amalfi ;  only then could we head to the museum . <s> We were also told that our first night's stay would be refunded . <s> Well ;  more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later ... there still hasn't been a refund . <s> I can't even get a manager to call me back . <s> The Amalfi wasn't all bad ;  it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance . <s> The coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers . <s> However ;  it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended . <s> One reason we picked the Amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles ;  but they seemed really small for queens . <s> Our view from our room was of the alley . <s> So ;  overall the best part of staying at the Amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor . <s> Very disappointing indeed ! <s> First let me say ;  I try not to be too critical ;  but in some cases the truth is warranted ! <s> We checked in and things seemed fine . <s> Location was excellent . <s> Woke up the first morning ;  to a slightly rumpled bed covered in  " stains "  ;  I hope-filthy and not 4 star hotel quality . <s> Requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door- a gentleman was there to let me know if I wanted it done to take off the privacy sign ;  I did and no one even came until later in the day . <s> The room was big enough ;  had no drawers ;  suposedly remodeled but carpet didn't reach the wall ;  toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken . <s> The mirrors were great and the water was always hot ! <s> The walls were paper thin ;  I heard every conversation the guests next door had . <s> They were not noisy but you could hear everything including the t . v . <s> through the walls and vents . <s> Internet was  $ 13 . 00 ;  worked for a bit and then not again ;  I called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later . <s> The hotel did give us a credit for the charges . <s> At this point ;  enough was enough ;  we packed our bags and checked out . <s> The front desk was very helpful- kudos to Rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops !  ! <s> The Omni Chicago Hotel is amazing little get away right on the Magnificent Mile in Chicago . <s> This hotel is warm and homey as well as modern and filled with amenities ! <s> The beds are very comfortable and there are flat screen televisions in the rooms  ( at least both times I have stayed )  . <s> The Windy City Spa provides a relaxing getaway as well . The indoor pool provides something fun for all ages and the customer service was excellent . <s> The garage was very secure and has unlimited in / out priviledges which made it nice to be able to access the car as much as you wanted without any penalty . <s> All in all ;  well worth it and will plan to stay again ! <s> Fairmont - I would not recommend the Fairmont . <s> I decided to spend a little extra and get the Fairmont Gold room while on a business trip and I sincerely regret it . <s> Sure ;  there is a good amount of space and the bathroom is huge ;  but is that really necessary for one or even two people ? <s> Plus ;  they make no mention of the charge for wi-fi until you get the bill at the end of your stay . <s> Really ? <s> I get free wi-fi with a 1 $  cup of coffee ;  but not with my 380 $  night at the Fairmont ? <s> Ridiculous <s> Recently stayed at the James Chicago and will NOT be returning anytime soon . <s> The staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous . <s> Also not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests . <s> There wasn't enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely . <s> Ultimately i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment . <s> I was visiting relatives in Chicago and wanted to stay in a hotel that emphasized luxury and was also environmentally friendly ;  and the Talbott seemed to fit the bill . <s> I also couldn't help but notice all the positive reviews online . <s> I figured I couldn't go wrong and I am happy to report the positive reviews are true . <s> First of all check in was a breeze . <s> I love their online reservation system . <s> It was easy to use and the information presented was quick and accurate . <s> Once I arrived in Chicago I was greeted by Tim at the door and I immediately felt like wanted and liked . <s> The receptionist was very polite and when she heard I was visiting Chicago for the first time ;  she upgraded my Deluxe King to an Executive King . <s> Score ! <s> The room was just as advertised ;  luxurious and convenient . <s> It was also exceptionally clean and this is very important to me because I am paranoid of germs and bed bugs . <s> Most importantly though ;  I got a good night's sleeep because the bed and pillows were super soft ;  but firm enough to help support my back . <s> I also used the Equinox Fitness Club and ;  wow ;  what a club . <s> This is another great amenity of the Talbott and easily beats other hotels skimpy workout centers . <s> My check-out was quick ;  easy ;  and painless . <s> This hotel gets my highest recommendation . <s> The facilities are immaculate and modern with the recent upgrade ;  the staff is ultra-friendly and competent ;  and the location was perfect for my needs . <s> Stayed with a group for a bachelorette party ;  and was disappointed . <s> The hotel is beautiful ;  the staff was all rather friendly . <s> The main problem was the room / sleeping situation . <s> We had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before ;  but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out  ( how that happens I don't know !  ! <s>  )  so they  " upgraded "  us to two  " suites "  with a king and a pull out . <s> First ;  this meant our party was split up and on different floors . <s> Second ;  that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch . <s>  :  (  I'm not a picky ;  unreasonable person ;  but that was the WORST  " bed "  I've ever slept on ! <s> It was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed . <s> Then there were the springs poking into our backs ALL night ! <s> Just awful ! <s> For the amount of money we spent I expected to be comfortable ! <s> I would not stay here again after this experience . <s> My wife and I were excited to visit and shop at Chicago's Magnificent Mile on Michigan Ave .  We chose the Intercontinental Hotel for it's reputation and location . <s> Man oh man ;  were we disappointed . <s> The check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well . <s> We got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains . <s> There were six people in line for her and we had to wait . <s> That was no problem since we weren't on a timetable . <s> When we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the Miracle Mile ;  she just pointed to the door and said ;   " It's right out the door . <s>  "  I asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying ;   " there's no such thing . <s>  "  I couldn't believe her abruptness . <s> We left the concierge stand not wanting to return . <s> Shopping went well and was fun . <s> We returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge . <s> We couldn't find a hotel directory in the room . <s> I called the Housekeeping Department and was told ;   " we're all out of directories here in the office . <s>  "  I asked if they could check a vacant room for one . <s> She said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms . <s> I hung up and thought I would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages . <s> Guess what ? <s> You guessed it ;  no phone book in the room . <s> I figured we could go get a drink at The Bar ;  the hotel's 20's themed lounge ;  and ask the bartender for suggestions . <s> We went to The Bar and there were only three other customers . <s> We sat at the bar and got our drinks . <s> As I was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions ;  his cell phone rang . <s> He answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk . <s> Twenty minutes later ;  he was still on the phone . <s> Tired and hungry ;  my wife and I went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from Pizza Hut . <s> Although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable ;  the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back . <s> A big thumbs down to the Intercontinental Chicago . <s> They need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary . <s> We stayed at the Fairmont two Saturday's in a row ;  and both stays were disappointing . <s> We had to call the hotel prior to each stay and both times it took the hotel 30-40 minutes to answer their phone . <s> For the price ;  we expected nicer decor  ( it looked cheaply done )  ;  more comfortable beds-the mattresses were too soft and the sheets too hard-pillows weren't comfortable either ;  a more accomodating front desk staff . <s> Our friends who were also there on the same dates will undoubtably add similar comments . <s> I was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro . <s> However ;  our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful . <s> The room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another . <s> The bathroom was small but well appointed . <s> Overall ;  it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased . <s> Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway . <s> One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I can't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe . <s> The area is also very close to public transportation  ( we used the trains exclusively )  and got around quite well without a car . <s> We would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others . <s> Homewood Suites - Stayed here for business and would not recommend . <s> Rooms were big and clean but lacked a desk or large enough table to get work done . <s> They provide breakfast in the morning but refused to refill the buffet after food ran out . <s> Be sure to get there early or you will go hungry . <s> I am going to stay away from the Homewood Suites next time I visit Chicago . <s> Recently my husband and I stayed at The James in Chicago for our  " night on the town "  . <s> After taking in a musical ;  we checked in at The James and were happily surprised with the customer appreciation and delicious room service . <s> The rooms were spotless and we were supplied with fresh towels for everything from showers to the spa to visiting the gym . <s> If I had known that they accepted pets beforehand ;  it would've been a great environment for our family lapdog . <s> Staying at The James in Chicago made our night a luxurious outing and will be a definite stop next time we are in Chicago . <s> The hotel is almost always very helpful . <s> This stay caused me to re-think if I like the Palmer House . <s> I had dirty covers for the bed . <s> It was also the smallest room in the hotel I am sure . <s> My husband and I usually come 8 times each year . <s> He is there doing Business and CTA work . <s> We are not pleased with the size of the room at all now . <s> Rooms have always had two chairs ;  desk ;  and usually 22 by 25 feet . <s> Not this room on the 11th floor . <s> It was only 15 X 17 approx . <s> The service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time . <s> In the past we had a bell man steal a  $ 300 . <s> pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially . <s> When my boyfriend and I checked into our room at the Omni Chicago ;  we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled ;  as if kids had been jumping on it . <s> That was just the first of our  " issues "  . <s> The glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them ;  and I saw a  ( dead-thank goodness ! <s>  )  roach behind the toilet . <s> We were given the hotel night stay by a friend ;  so we decided to just deal with it . <s> We ordered some munchies from the kitchen ;  and the chips were stale ;  and the dip smelled sour . <s> After coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies ;  we were able to enjoy our stay -- but I would not recommend this place to anyone ! <s> Stayed at the Monaco on my way skiing at Easter  &  loved it . <s> Staff were helpful  &  friendly ;  room was huge with fantastic view of the river . <s> Central location ;  5 min walk to the EL . <s> Adjoining Restaurant / Bar ;  great food  &  service . <s> I have stayed in more expensive ;  supposedly better ;  hotels in Chicago ;  but this is the best . <s> Thanks Monaco ;  I'll be back . <s> Don't ever stay at this hotel ! <s>  ;  Conrad Chicago is the worst hotel you can imagine . <s> First of all ;  THE PRICE ! <s> you not get what you pay for . <s> I paid  & 217 . 50 one night for a room that did not even had a TV !  ! <s> that's ridiculous ! <s> The bathroom did not work ;  and it was nasty ! <s> the bed sheets seemed like used ;  as if some people slept there and they smelled bad ! <s> After my experience with Conrad Chicago ;  I will please ask you to reconsider getting a room in this hotel . <s> You get better service and accommodations even in a 1 star motel ! <s> My stay at this hotel was one of the best I have ever had ! <s> The location ;  service and accommodations were all outstanding !  ! <s> The lobby area is beautiful as was my room . <s> In the room there was more than enough space ;  which is difficult to find in Chicago hotels . <s> My only gripe was the room was a little dark . <s> Sure ;  staying at a small ;  upper-class hotel like the Talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it . <s> The service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed . <s> The room service took a bit longer than I would have liked ;  however ;  the food was good quality . <s> Another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the Equinox Fitness Center . <s> Finally ;  the location is PERFECT !  ! <s> It's located in a beautiful area of the city near the Gold Coast ;  which has many very good restaurants . <s> A personal favorite of mine is Mario's ;  a nice Italian place nearby . <s> Overall ;  my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were ;  for the most part ;  insignificant . <s> This is a great find for downtown Chicago . <s> The price is right and the staff are excellent . <s> As noted ;  there is construction going on around the hotel ;  but I didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping . <s> I asked for a quiet room on an upper floor ;  and was gladly given one . <s> The lobby is small ;  the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel . <s> The concierge ;  Stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations  ( along with a complimentary appetizer )  . <s> We had a standard room ;  and it was spacious ;  tastefully decorated -- everything we needed . <s> The bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking -- and the MP3 compatible radio was a nice perk . <s> Just can't say enough about how nice the staff are -- every single person you meet . <s> Would definitely stay here again . <s> This hotel is ok but is not the best for the money . <s> First of all the parking prices are exorbitant . <s> I know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high . <s> Also ;  the service at this hotel was poor . <s> I felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general ;  and the staff at The Palmer House seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us . <s> In addition I feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet . <s> Also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you . <s> I would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about The Palmer House . <s> This was one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Chicago . <s> I've also tried Amalfi and a number of larger chain hotels downtown . <s> This one was the best . <s> Great service ;  beautiful room ;  roomy bathroom ;  top-notch amenities . <s> Went there for business and the Hard Rock Hotel on Wacker Drive was recommended . <s> I was to meet my girlfriend there who had arrived 1 hour before me . <s> When she go there at 6PM ;  the room wasn't ready ;  the phone didn't work ;  the shower didn't work . <s> When I got there she was already very upset . <s> I called the manager to complain ;  but was put on hold for 30 min . <s> I could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasn't any wall separating us . <s> I asked for a wake up call ;  but nobody called me the next morning . <s> When I called to complain the next day ;  the told me the phone system was down . <s> Ordered room service and got the wrong order ... <s> The building is very old and the elevator sounds like it is on its last breath ... <s> I would not recommend it to anyone Patrick <s> For starters ;  I had trouble reaching the front desk . <s> Every time I called it would ring endlessly ! <s> When finally I did reach someone ;  she was snooty ;  impolite ;  and altogether unhelpful . <s> Being from the south and not knowing anything about Chicago I was hoping the staff would have been more helpful in guiding me around such a large metropolitan area . <s> As I was there on business ;  I was really looking forward to the Wi-Fi access so that my business activity would go uninterrupted . <s> Unfortunately ;  this was not the case . <s> After multiple log in attempts I ended up going to a local  " internet bar . <s>  "  As attractive as the rooms and the hotel itself were ;  the complete and utter lack of service and delivering up to expectations was disappointing . <s> We also just returned from a frigid weekend in Chicago . <s> I booked the Ambassador East because of its great rate ;   $ 89 . 00 with my AAA card and we were delighted . <s> Yes ;  the rooms show some signs of wear ;  but the warmth and charm far make up for it . <s> This was such a pleasant change from the sleek ;  modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels . <s> We became members of the I preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in . <s> We had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom . <s> We had wonderful food at the Pump Room which is classic . <s> Our oatmeal there was so tastefully served ;  I'd love to have some right now ! <s> The location was great . <s> Had it been normal winter weather ;  we could have easily walked to Michigan Avenue for shopping ;  but due to the minus 20 degree windchills ;  we opted for a cab which was less than a  $ 5 . 00 fare . <s> We also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all . <s> We would definitely stay here again ! <s> Me and my husband got married here . <s> We loved the atmosphere of our suite . <s> It felt like home away from home . <s> They have a nice pool . <s> The rooms were clean and the staff was courteous . <s> Thanks so much for doing such a great job with our wedding . <s> Amy C .  of Los Angelas ;  California <s> Hilton Chicago - It's a bit pricey ;  but that evil is somewhat unavoidable in downtown Chicago . <s> You'd be hard-pressed to find anywhere else in the area with accommodations as nice for the same price . <s> Features that set this hotel apart are its unconventional yet agreeable styling ;  HD TV's in all the rooms ;  and scenic lake views from most of the rooms . <s> There are two decent restaurants in the hotel ;  but there's plenty of other options like pizzerias ;  a Thai place ;  Jimmy John's sandwiches ;  and an upscale Italian restaurant called Gioco  ( my personal choice )  easily within walking distance if you get bored of the main offerings . <s> It's about half an hour away from O'Hare and only 15 minutes away from Midway International Airport ;  so it's pretty conveniently located if you happen to be a flyer . <s> Overall ;  a solid choice . <s> At first my husband and I were really excited for our family to enjoy the T-Rex Experience package . <s> We figured it would be a great deal package even though the hotel itself felt too  " ritzy "  for us to travel with our four children . <s> But after two nights of downtown Chicago fun we realized that The Talbott transcends it's ritzy look and truly embraces a family friendliness which we thoroughly enjoyed . <s> We had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well . <s> They were subject to a brief staff strike and did not inform guests and in fact failed to tell us about the strike and our room never was cleaned . <s> After 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels . <s> Overall service other than check in was poor for a reportedly 4 star hotel . <s> Check-in was fast ;  the room was perfect ;  and there were no problems . <s> This is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable . <s> I got a very good deal for a one-night stay ;  but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet . <s> If you are bored of the routine hotel fare ;  walk two blocks to Gourmet Pantry  ( 155 N .  Michigan )  for a refreshing change . <s> Sofitel Chicago Water Tower is a four star hotel that is minutes aways from the Magnificent mile ;  Navy Peir ;  The museum of contemperary art ;  lake michigan and upscale boutiques . <s> This hotel is great for tourest . <s> it has 450 great rooms and 33 high end sweets . <s> It has a modern diesighn and rich arcitechusall legacy . <s> IT has great food and out door dinning it also has a great veiws ;  while drinking wine and champane cotails in there amazing bar . <s> Overall this hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in . <s> Will start by saying the employees were wonderful ;  especially in the restaurant  /  bar employees ;  could not have been nicer ..... what appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyond .... Unfortunately ;  that's where it ends ! <s> The rooms ;  in my opinion ;  appeared different then pictures and were worn and ratty ... you know ;  uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area ...  the first room I was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my window ! <s>  ! I kid you not ;  they seemed as if they were about 15-20 ft from my window !  ! <s> And this was after I specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent view .. I was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly ;  again ...  just worn out !  ! <s>  ! NOT a 4 star hotel ;  this seemed to be closer to a 2 ;  perhaps being extremely kind 3 star ... I travel on business so I know the difference ... I merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand ! <s> I complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit ;  she made sure the door was fixed ASAP . <s> They gave me a bottle of wine to compensate .. which I utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next 2 days .... I wanted to give Omni a shot ... big mistake ... <s> Unfortunately ;  brought a friend with me to show her how great Chicago was and I was soooo embarrassed ;  as I had chosen the hotel ... She was extremely disappointed as well ... should have gone with my first instinct which was the Conrad !  ! <s> Lesson learned ! <s> Stayed for 2 nights at The James ;  wonderful location 2 mins walk to Michigan Avenue with all the shops . <s> Staff here were all incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly . <s> Nothing was too much trouble . <s> Rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable I have slept in . <s> Room was very clean ;  had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a 42in flat screen tv . <s> There was a bar area with stereo ;  mini bar and coffee maker . <s> There was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area . <s> Bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo ;  conditioner ;  shower gel and body lotion . <s> Hotel is also  " pet friendly "  . <s> There was even a large bowl of iced water and a barrel of dog biscuits at the front door of the hotel  !  !  !  . <s> Pets even had their own options on the room sevice menu . <s> Fairmont Chicago - I recently stayed for a night at the Fairmont while I was in Chicago for a job interview . <s> The room was okay ;  clean at least and with big windows ;  but for some reason the bathroom didn't have a hairdryer  ( important for me ;  and a pretty standard amenity ..  )  . <s> I had to call the front desk and ask for one ;  and then it took THREE HOURS for someone to bring it up . <s> The guy who ended up bringing it was polite and very apologetic ;  but I mean come on ..  three hours ? <s> Besides that ;  things were decent ;  pretty much what you'd expect from any 4 star hotel . <s> I ordered room service late  ( it's available 24 / 7 )  and the food came quickly ;  but it was nothing too special . <s> The extra fee for in-room wifi access was pretty exorbitant ;  but I think there was free wifi down in the lobby . <s> I guess I probably wouldn't recommend the Fairmont to a friend ;  but I wouldn't go out of my way to warn them away . <s> My family and I have just had a two week holiday in Chicago ;  and we stayed for a week at the Hilton Towers . <s> We had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel . <s> The sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable . <s> If you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels ;  maybe this wouldn't be your thing . <s> However if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz ;  you will be bowled over by this hotel . <s> The place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby . <s> Tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating . <s> We got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place ! <s> My wife and I stayed at the Conrad Chicago Hilton a few weeks back . <s> I had a conference in the Windy City ;  and my wife decided she'd come along to do some shopping . <s> First off let me say ;  typically I LOVE staying in hotels - any chance I get ;  i'll spend it away from home in a comfy hotel bed . <s> That said ;  this place was terrible . <s> The room had a slight odor to it ;  kind of a fishy smell . <s> The people at the front desk were rude to us . <s> And I found a soiled pair of women's panties under the bed . <s> Gross ! <s> Not to mention that once we got home ;  we both had bug bites up and down our legs -- - now we're worried we brought bedbugs home with us ! <s> If I could take this trip back I would . <s> What a terrible place . <s> Shame on you Conrad Hilton ;  shame on you ! <s> Stayed here for two days in the first week in January ;  when hotel was very quiet . <s> Got a big corner room . <s> Staff are friendly ;  decor is modern ;  and there's a huge choice of pastries and cakes and breads for breakfast ;  which you take back to your room . <s> The free hors d'oevres with the drinks are great antipasti - olives ;  breads ;  cheeses and meats ;  marinated vegetables . <s> This was a really easy hotel to stay in ;  fairly central - a couple of blocks away from the 'L' ;  and quiet ;  despite the building work opposite . <s> If you're in Chicago ;  stay here . <s> If you are looking for a true luxury experience ;  Hotel Monaco Chicago is not the place to go . <s> I stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience . <s> I did not get it . <s> Check in was not a pleasant experience . <s> The wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful . <s> The room was ok ;  no roaches or anything ;  but it was small and cramped . <s> And the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel . <s> The house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8 : 30a in the morning . <s> When I asked them to come back later ;  they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back . <s> And getting extra towels was like pulling teeth . <s> I don't know if they thought I was going to steal them or what . <s> The room service food that I ordered was fine ;  but it took forever to be delivered and was half-cold by the time I received it . <s> When I called the front desk to complain ;  they apologized ;  but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food . <s> They have a restaurant at the hotel ;  but I did not bother to try it . <s> The prices were ridiculous ;  the menu was limited ;  and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel . <s> I was really disenchanted with this experience . <s> At  $ 400 plus dollars a night ;  I received mediocre accomedations and poor service . <s> Spend your hard-earned money somewhere else . <s> This morning ;  I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences I've ever had :  Hard Rock Hotel ;  Chicago . <s> I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the  " Preferred Hotels "  group . <s> Upon checking in ;  I was  " greeted "  by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show . <s> My room was poorly lit and dirty . <s> The desk / desk chair was covered in sticky ;  dried soda pop  ( or something else ?

So she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key . <s> I did what she told me and went to the bell station . <s> However ;  people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key . <s> A bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk . <s> I finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes . <s> As other people pointed out before ;  the room I got was small and old with a twin bed ;  and I could hear people next door using the bathroom . <s> This was not a pleasant experience ;  even though I paid over 100 dollars to the hotel . <s> I was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the Olympia in Seattle . <s> The decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring . <s> Biggest disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room . <s> The wireless was very slow and the hard-wire from the wall did not work at all . <s> I did request a replacement of the wall wire ;  but it did no help . <s> This hotel can do better than this . <s> With a 5 star rating ;  it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered  --  but ;  was just a mediocre experience for me . <s> Even the bed covers were not that special . <s> Needs more intense management . <s> Next time ;  I will try the Trump facility Thanks <s> The hotel was not one of the better ones I stayed at . <s> the room was seemingly nice at first ;  but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it . <s> I had the same sheets for a three days before I called and requested they be changed . <s> Also ;  the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms ;  which interfered with my sleep . <s> I ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also ;  and asked for a well done steak ;  and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor . <s> This is definitely not a hotel I would recommend to anyone . <s> My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-October . <s> We decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of Chicago in a week . <s> I'll start out by saying that this was a great experience . <s> At check-in ;  I indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite . <s> The Ambassador East is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the North end of the Magnificent Mile . <s> It is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on Rush . <s> Our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed . <s> Our suite  ( on the 3rd floor )  had two very large closets ;  a large  " living room "  and a large bedroom . <s> The bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough . <s> If I would have payed full price for this suite ;  I probably would have given it a rating of 4 ;  but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and I had such a great time here ;  I decided to give it a five . <s> It is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful . <s> My wife and I decided to eat at The Pump Room restaurant ;  but we were not very impressed . <s> We found the food and service mediocre . <s> The atmosphere was probably pretty neat when Sinatra used to eat there back in the day ;  but not anymore . <s> Although we were unimpressed by the Pump Room ;  the staff were kind enough to seat us in the  " Sinatra Booth "  which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains . <s> That neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here . <s> The Ambassador East is an older hotel ;  but it is in a charming older neighborhood . <s> The staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me . <s> When we are in Chicago again ;  we will definitely consider staying at the Ambassador East again . <s> Triple A rate with upgrade to view room was less than  $ 200 which also included breakfast vouchers . <s> Had a great view of river ;  lake ;  Wrigley Bldg . <s>  &  Tribune Bldg . <s> Most major restaurants ;  Shopping ;  Sightseeing attractions within walking distance . <s> Large room with a very comfortable bed . <s> I stayed at the Omni with a Band that what in town . <s> The room was amazing . <s> Just walking in ;  the hotel was gorgeous . <s> I have no complaints . <s> Prompt Room service ;  Friendly front desk . <s> Many shops ;  beautiful fountin . <s> Just an all around great hotel in a great City . <s> The magnificent mile in Chicago is a great place to visit ;  and staying at the Affinia Chicago just made it that much better !

<s> Very impressed overall ! <s> intercontinentalchicago - I recently stayed at the intercontinental hotel in Chicago for a business conference and had an excellent time . <s> I stayed in a deluxe room which was very roomy and allowed me to stretch out between meetings . <s> The room had large windows on two of the walls with a great view of the city . <s> One of the meetings was actually held inside the hotel ;  and I must say the food was fantastic . <s> I had the smoked salmon ;  and it was as good as anything I eat during the trip ;  which is saying something in Chicago . <s> Also ;  check out the belgian waffles from the hotel menu for breakfast one day during your stay ;  you won't regret it . <s> Thanks Sheraton Towers for the invite to enjoy your indoor pool while a guest at your hotel recently . <s> I did not know that the skyline of Chicago could be so beautiful or an afternoon at the pool so enjoyable . <s> I'll be back soon and look forward to a seeing Chicago again . <s> When I had to visit Chicago for business I asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the Hotel Allegro . <s> After my stay I can honestly say that I agree . <s> From the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities ;  everything was thought of . <s> The only place I find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home . <s> I now know where I will be staying every time I have business in this city ;  and anyone I know who is doing the same will hear so . <s> We stayed at the Hard Rock for one night to do some intense ;  day-after-Thanksgiving shopping . <s> It really is a great hotel . <s> The rooms are really cool ;  and we were just in the basic one . <s> The bed is extremely comfortable ;  with the softest sheets and great pillows . <s> The technology in the room is great . <s> They have nice upscale tolietries in the bathrooms . <s> For a very modern room ;  it is still comfortable and homey . <s> The location is perfect for getting wherever you want to go . <s> The staff were very nice and helpful . <s> The bar is really funky with an interesting martini menu . <s> One of the best hotels I have stayed at in Chicago . <s> Really enjoyed it and would highly recommend . <s> I was in town to visit my cousin an stayed for three nights at this wonderful hotel . <s> Its so close to the shopping i wanted to do with my cousin  ;  granted i had a personal guide a . k . a . <s> my cousin Janice . <s> The amenities were unbelieveable an the service was great with the upmost hospitality . <s> Would recomend to everyone great for kids an adults . <s> The room and view were spectacular ;  the beds were very comfy and the room was emaculate . <s> My friend book this hotel for us for a girls weekend in Chicago . <s> Lets just say we were thankful we didn't have to spend much time in the room . <s> The carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way . <s> The furniture was worn and outdated . <s> The place was gross and just wasn't worth the money we spent on it . <s> The only redeeming quality was the door man ;  we was very nice and helpful . <s> We booked the Amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in Chicago . <s> The hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location . <s> However ;  when i booked the hotel I was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only  $ 10 more . <s> That was great until I checked in . <s> The corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley . <s> During the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley . <s> It would seem that this is a place for them to congregate . <s> On top of this ;  the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning . <s> The noise was crazy loud . <s> I think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location . <s> The staff is extremely friendly and very helpful . <s> During a recent business trip to Chicago I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Allegro . <s> The lobby gave a good first impression . <s> It was a very clean with a modern designer's feel and the customer service was great . <s> I proceeded to the counter to check-in and within 5 minutes I had the key to my room . <s> I was told to check out the infamous 312 restaurant but I was tired from my flight . <s> I checked into my room . <s> The room was great . <s> A king size bed 37 "  flat screen tv and standard desk all designer furniture . <s> After I unpacked I had to check my email . <s> Hooking up to their Wi-Fi was quick and painless ! <s> I had a good night sleep and early wake up the next day for my business meeting . <s> I decided to try the restaurant for breakfast . <s> I had an omelet and fruit . <s> The restaurant was great and the food was perfect . <s> I only wish I had more time to stay and enjoy lunch ;  nevertheless duty called . <s> The concierge had my taxi waiting for me right after breakfast and I was off to work . <s> I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago . <s> It's one of the best I've ever stayed at after multiple business trips . <s> everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money ;  they have excellent customer service ;  the employees there really cared about their guests ;  there was always coffee ;  tea ;  hot chocolate in the lobby ;  good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer ;  the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions ;  the room did the job ;  there was a kitchen ;  2 flat screen tv's ;  and a pullout couch included ;  it was close to the  " eL "  ;  but for us we found the buses to be more useful . <s> I would recommend getting a pass ;  we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for  $ 14 which we got at jewel osco ;  not too far from the hotel ;  for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families ;  but us three girls didn't mind ;  so i would definitely recommend this place ;  it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels . <s> I enjoyed my stay at the Talbott Hotel . <s> It is on the more expensive side ;  but it is all worth it . <s> I got the Talbott tradition package ;  which was  $ 245 for two people and included a  $ 30 breakfast credit on check out day . <s> The rooms are huge ! <s> The beds are soft and comfortable . <s> They include Aveda bath products ;  which is a plus in my book . <s> They also have a nice fitness area  &  pool you can use while you stay there . <s> One thing I thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone . <s> My boyfriend also liked the Ihome audio system . <s> The location of this hotel is very convenient as well ;  its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast . <s> But ;  what I like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to . <s> They were one of the first hotels to be Green Sealed . <s> Overall I had a great stay at Talbott Hotel ! <s> Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life . <s> The attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night's sleep I've ever experienced in a hotel . <s> Gorgeous LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment . <s> Sofitel is worth the extra  $ 's . <s> My stay here was superb . <s> The view from my windows was stunning ;  as I looked out I could see the beautiful Grant Park . <s> The room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting . <s> The bed was very comfortable . <s> The wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips . <s> THe hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca . <s> Overall I thouroughly enjoyed my stay here . <s> The Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago has it all :  location ;  comfort ;  and rockability ! <s> We stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago recently and found it to be amazing ! <s> The location was perfect as it is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile ;  Navy Pier ;  and Lake Michigan . <s> It was just a short ride by bus or cab to the sports stadiums ;  Shedd Aquarium or the Museum of Science and Industry ! <s> The food ;  although it was pricey ;  was great ! <s> There is a spa on site if you need a little time to relax and recoup after all that rockin' ;  and if you have pets ;  they get the ROYAL treatment ;  complete with gifts ! <s> I would highly recommend the Hard Rock Hotel of Chicago ! <s> We enjoyed our stay at the James in Chicago very much . <s> The hotel is elegant and uber-modern ! <s> Each room simply exudes class . <s> I have never stayed in a nicer hotel ;  to be honest . <s> The hotel features an upscale restaurant ;  though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments . <s> There is also a full-service spa at the hotel . <s> The most surprising thing about the James is that pets are allowed ;  our dog didn't have to stay at home . <s> How cool is that ? <s> There are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking ;  24-hour room service ;  24-hour concierge ;  shoe shine service ;  and laundry / dry cleaning . <s> The hotel is located right on the Magnificent Mile ;  so that location is absolutely superb . <s> You are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world . <s> I would recommend the James to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to Chicago . <s> We loved our stay at the Talbott . <s> We were in Chicago to attend the theater show Dirty Dancing . <s> We booked our room through Orbitz and received a nice discount . <s> When we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy . <s> We were upgraded to a King bed suite . <s> The suite was well decorated and spacious . <s> My wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom . <s> We loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the Talbott on our next trip to Chicago . <s> Highly recommended . <s> My stay at the Homewood Suites in downtown Chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live . <s> I was there for a week long conference . <s> Although my reservations had been made months in advance ;  they did not have a suite for me when I arrived ;  resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night . <s> Once my room was ready ;  I was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen :  barely large enough to move around ;  and very few utensils to cook with . <s> The pool was only open for limited hours ;  and I should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit . <s> At night I was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside . <s> My overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite . <s> I will not book here ever again . <s> I was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late September ;  and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle ;  but affected me and my husband . <s> For example ;  he got locked out of our room 2 times ;  once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa . <s> The other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony ;  so that was stressful because he lost some time . <s> The keycard just would stop working . <s> Then a fuse blew ;  so we had no power while trying to get ready . <s> It happened to me also ;  coming back from the spa ;  and I called on the hallway phone to get help . <s> Luckily ;  right after that ;  an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if I had been waiting long -- as if she knew this was a problem . <s> I said no ;  and she called down to check . <s> Apparently ;  no one had even called Security to get me back into my room ! <s> She had a set of keys and let me in ;  thank god . <s> Then ;  on our wedding night ;  my husband wanted to order from room service . <s> It was a little after 10 : 30pm . <s> We were told that room service was closed for the night -- even though all the literature in the room brags about  " 24 hour dining . <s>  "  That fact was never communicated to us when we checked in . <s> I feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping . <s> We later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off ;  so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service . <s> I don't think if I would recommend that anyone stay at this Fairmont nor will I ever again . <s> BTW ;  the spa is great to hang out in ;  even if you're not doing a massage . <s> Room :  I stayed in the 16thz floor . <s> 2 double bed room . <s> The room has a decent size . <s> Equipment is state of the art . <s> The Furniture are stylish . <s> Room Size was very nice . <s> I could have left my big suitcase opened throughout the stay  ( which rarely happens in most hotels  ;  )  )  42 "  LCD Screen Complimentary WiFi in the room The bed and pillows are of extrodinary quality which provided an excellent deep sleep to me . <s> Location Located quite central . <s> Shopping streets are in reach of 5 minutes by feet . <s> Midway Airport is in reach by cab within 30 minutes  ( ~30 USD )  . <s> Service - Spa and Fitness exists - though I did not use . <s> - Restuarant  ( not used )  - Business Center - Very friendly and helpful staff . <s>  ( even printed our boarding passes at the reception )  I do travel frquently ;  and do recommend this hotel for a business stay ;  as also for an overnight with friends going shopping ;  partying whatever in the city center of Chicago . <s> Pricing was very moderate for teh standard being provided at a downtown hotel . <s> I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago ;  Il . <s> From the start ;  the experience was bad . <s> The room was filthy ;  there were no towels ;  and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation . <s> I will never stay there again . <s> I could not have been more dissatisfied . <s> Amalifa Hotel in Chicago was an extremely pleasant and exciting hotel experience . <s> I was taken away by the design and decor of the building and the exceptional customer service . <s> I will definitely be returning for another stay ! <s> What a wonderful experience ;  super great ;  helpful ;  friendly staff . <s> Angie at the front desk made sure my husbands birthday would be great . <s> Our room was beautiful . <s> Angie suggested we go to Sullivans for dinner .. perfect choice ;  make the reservation for us . <s>  ( best seat in the house and a special dessert )  wow ... Above and beyond what any other hotel or staff has done for us before .. Looking forward to staying there again  &  again . <s> THANKS AGAIN <s> My wife and I came to spend the weekend in downtown Chicago for shopping and we found this Conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that doesn't make you feel lost in the Convention world . <s> We have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past . <s> Our Suite has view on Michigan avenue with a bit of the Lake at the end . <s> Staff was very professional ;  pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable . <s> Internet is free n the rooms and I am making my review from there . <s> Hilton Chicago - My stay at hotel Hilton was very satisfying . <s> The room I stayed was very comfortable . <s> The room had all the top-notch basic amenities . <s> I stayed at the 7th floor and the view of the city was spectacular which added to the beauty of the hotel stay . <s> Also on the comfortable beds I had a fantastic time lazing over a recent movie on the HD television set in the room . <s> The bathrooms were very clean and tidy which showed how cleanliness was a top priority at the hotel . <s> Also the location of the hotel is very strategic as most of the tourist attractions around the city are within comfortable distance along with easy access to local public transportation . <s> I would recommend this hotel to everyone and would definitely come back . <s> When we got checked and arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was the light didn't come on when we flipped the switch upon entering . <s> The room was not very clean at all . <s> Dust had collected on the back of the tv and on the stand behind it ;  on the window sill and stains on the carpet . <s> We had requested wireless internet service but it was down the entire first night . <s> The mattress was very hard making for an uncomfortable night . <s> The jacuzzi was out of order also . <s> When asked to be moved to a different room we were informed that there were not others available . <s> Atrocious . <s> Here's our story :  My wife and I are Californians but met as students at the University of Chicago . <s> To celebrate our 10th anniversary ;  we decided to travel back to the Windy City and revisit all of the places we frequented when we were first falling in love . <s> When it came to lodging ;  we knew we wanted a suite but little else mattered . <s> We wanted to revisit the city and didn't intend to spend very much time in our room . <s> As a result ;  we didn't spend very much time researching hotels . <s> Big mistake . <s> Our stay at Homewood Suites could not have been worse . <s> Our room ;  which ;  I should mention ;  took a full two hours for them to prepare even though we had booked it months in advance ;  was filthy . <s>  ( My wife found a dead cockroach in the bathroom . <s>  )  The staff was rude and indifferent . <s> The chocolates included in the Romance Package could not have cost the hotel more than a dollar . <s> Cleaning staff failed to show up . <s> Front desk offered apologies but little else . <s> Suffice it to say ;  we checked out early . <s> Never before have I seen such a poorly-managed hotel . <s> Truly shameful . <s> Stay away ! <s> This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be . <s> The website and it's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in . <s> The amenities were not what I was looking for ;  and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there . <s> My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels . <s> The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area ;  and they were not very prompt when responding to requests . <s> I understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there ;  but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service . <s> I don't think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon . <s> Just what I needed at James :  I can't tell you how impressed I was with my stay at the James Chicago Hotel . <s> I came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the James by a friend . <s> The crisp ;  clean ;  contemporary ambiance made me feel like I was on a relaxed vacation rather than work . <s> It was luxury without being over the top . <s> My room was clean ;  comfortable and was above all standards comfortable . <s> In my down time I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the  " JBar "  ;  and I highly recommend dinner at the  " David Burke Primehouse "  The customer service from all the staff members ;  from front desk ;  to house keeping to the bartender was excellent . <s> I plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience . <s> The Hotel Monaco is a hotel that some say has  " character "  . <s> I found the decor tacky and had a hard time relaxing in the room designed with clashing colors and  " contemporary furniture "  . <s> I found the fact that you have to be a member of the Kimpton rewards club to get free wi-fi access to be annoying at the least . <s> Because of their pet-friendly policy ;  our room smelled like a wet dog ;  and a canine  " guest "  down the hall kept us up all night with his howling . <s> Perhaps the dog would have howled less if the 24-hour room service were faster . <s> We waited an hour and a half for our order :  meaning we did not get our dinner we wanted at 10 : 00 pm until midnight ! <s> All in all ;  we would not stay here again . <s> The views and location are great ;  but for the money there are better places to stay in Chicago . <s> We booked a room at the Hilton Chicago for two nights to stay the weekend ;  but upon arrival our reservation could not be found . <s> I even provided the hotel with our confirmation number ;  but it still wasn't available ! <s> Fortunately ;  another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us . <s> Once we settled into our room for the night  ( after a long flight )  ;  there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom . <s> Apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival . <s> Needless to say ;  with both of these poor experiences in just one night ;  I will be hesitant to EVER stay in this hotel again ;  let alone any other Hilton around . <s> Please consider someplace else before the Hilton Chicago ! <s> Very luxurious and worth the money . <s> If you are looking to relax and unwind in a great hotel then this is the one to choose . <s> The staff was great and friendly . <s> Dont forget the 24 hour room service which is a great treat . <s> My stay at the James Hotel in Chicago was fantastic ! <s> The hotel was clean ;  modern and everything I had hoped for . <s> The staff was fabulous and went above and beyond all of our expectations . <s> All of our needs were more than met and I will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates . <s> My wife and I stayed at the James recently and we had a great experience . <s> The hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location . <s> It's in a quiet location ;  yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to . <s> We upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost . <s> It didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have ;  but it was elegantly appointed ;  spacious ;  and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet . <s> The service was amazing . <s> Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful ;  as well as knowledgeable . <s> This was true from the doormen at the front ;  to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant . <s> Both Concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions ;  and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out . <s> The breakfast at Prime downstairs is among the best I have ever had in a hotel ;  this goes for the room service as well . <s> Dinner there was good ;  but not great . <s> I mentioned almost flawless ;  as there was a situation that occurred involving the Spa in the hotel . <s> It involved scheduling and was aggravating ;  as the hotel actively encourages its use . <s> However ;  Caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied ;  following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with . <s> The experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly . <s> Overall ;  we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits . <s> Sheraton Chicago Hotel  &  Towers - My stay at this hotel was awful . <s> This was my first visit to Chicago and I was really excited about it ;  but staying at Sheraton ruined it . <s> My boyfriend and I had to wait for 4 hours to check into our room ;  and it was surprisingly small and dirty . <s> You would not expect a room so small and dirty at such a high price ! <s> We then requested to change a room and it took the staff another 3 hours to get it done . <s> We were satisfied with the condition of our second room and then decided to go to the pool ;  and we were so disappointed . <s> There were no one at the pool ;  and the staff knew so little about their hotel that we asked three people to finally get there ! <s> The only thing that one cannot pick is the location of this hotel . <s> It is right at downtown Chicago and very easy to go to everywhere . <s> Other than that ;  I did not find anything in this hotel that worth the price it charged . <s> I would not recommend this hotel to any friend and I would certainly not stay there again . <s> We were disappointed with this hotel . <s> The staff seems hurried and unhelpful . <s> Our room was not made up until after 5 PM despite several requests . <s> The blower in the hallway blew freezing air ;  but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it . <s> The lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit . <s> The room and bed was comfortable ;  but the cream and and modern art work are not our style . <s> The room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer . <s> Certainly not worth the rate compared to other hotels I have stayed at in Chicago . <s> My wife and I stayed here for a weekend in Chicago and had an okay experience . <s> The location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown Chicago hotel . <s> Everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in Chicago means a taxi ride . <s> The other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere . <s> I don't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby ;  the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere . <s> The pool / spa / excercise room was not very impressive either . <s> It is accessible by walking through the business center corridor ;  wondering if you're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small . <s> There is also no hot tub and the  " spa "  is a closet with a massage table . <s> The concierge was helpful but the people that answer the  " sheraton promise "  phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors . <s> The beds were super comfortable . <s> I think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do MUCH better in downtown Chicago . <s> Fairmont Chicago ;  Millennium Park - My wife and I just got back from Chicago ;  where we stayed at the Fairmont . <s> The trip was awesome and the great food ;  elegantly styled room and amazing service at the hotel were definitely a large reason our trip was so good . <s> I highly recommend this hotel ! <s> I booked this hotel with great expectations . <s> I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . <s> Upon arriving to the hotel  ( at the exact time I indicated in my reservation )  I was told I've been  " downgraded "  to a lesser quality room . <s> I travel very often and never had this before . <s> Moreover ;  I did not hear a single  " I'm sorry "  ;  it was like usual business . <s> What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me  " I will decrease the rate for you "   " what do you think ;  nice eh ? <s>  "  like he was doing me a favor !  !  !  ! <s> They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course  ( which is the legal thing to do ;  since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money )  . <s> They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . <s> I did not know what to say ;  since this never happened to me before ;  also with family present did not want to start arguing . <s> The rooms were nice  ( not as nice as I thought )  and location is good ;  however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . <s> That is enough for me not to go back again . <s> The Allegro in downtown Chicago is a great stay /  part of the Kimpton Group boutique hotels the Allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price /  they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city . <s> i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'EL' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel /  otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city  . <s> the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors ; comfortable beds and in my case great views . <s> if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days  /  kimpton does a great job and their properties are  " class acts "  <s> We usually stay at the Sofitel but thought we would try the Conrad for a change . <s> I don't think I would rate this hotel over the Sofitel but it was still 1st class . <s> But I do think the service was better at the Conrad . <s> We arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left . <s> Normally service goes down hill then but our waiter Eric was the best . <s> Even when I kept ordering my after dinner ports . <s> The meal may not have been The Chop House but it was still very good . <s> The bar was ok ;  no Crown Reserve . <s> They did have the Cask 16 at  $ 24 a drink ;  ouch . <s> The room service was very quick . <s> Our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits . <s> The only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor . <s> It was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off . <s> Which wasn't so bad since my wife smokes . <s> The temp on the 5th where the lobby ;  bar ;  and restaurant was fine . <s> We enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in Sept .  One last thing ;  if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast . <s> Go to the West Egg ;  only a few blocks away . <s> The location is ideal . <s> They have very high ceilings so the rooms appear much larger than they are . <s> The views are great . <s> There were fresh flowers in the bathroom . <s> They had all white bedding . <s> You feel like a princess there . <s> The James Chicago - Though the hotel was at a great location ;  the rooms were very small and I could hear normal talks in the adjacent rooms . <s> I had to figure out myself how to connect to the wireless internet connection and only to know that the speed was very slow and the range itself was not good . <s> The breakfast was not worth the money . <s> I would never go there again . <s> We booked directly with the Intercontinental -- a special room for our wedding night . <s> After our wedding ;  we went to the Hotel excited and happy . <s> When we got there ;  the night changed . <s> We were treated rudely and with no respect . <s> They told us there was  " no room "  even though we had a confirmation number . <s> Instead of showing any empathy ;  they told us to go sit down while they figured out  " what to do with us "  . <s> My husband was in his tux and I was in my wedding gown ! <s> No apology ! <s> No concern ! <s> We were given  $ 20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where they'd  " found "  a room . <s> The Intercontinental RUINED our wedding night . <s> We are telling anyone and everyone of our experience . <s> This place was supposed to be elegant . <s> We've never been treated so poorly . <s> We will never stay in another Intercontinental Hotel and highly recommend you do not contribute to a place that would do this to a newly married couple !  !  ! <s> STEER clear of this place . <s> I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Women's hospital oir my surgery . <s> Few things I really didn't enjoy - I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doors . No noise insulation at all ! <s> Very dusty between window frames ( I understand - cars ; pollution )  but it looked like it wasn't cleaned for a very long time . One more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side . <s> I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time ... We didn't notice the problem until very-very late . The Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort  ! <s> Strange but every hotel I stayed @ was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paper . Affinia didn't even offer that . Looked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady ! <s> Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  !  ! <s> Hopefully ; no more surgeries for me ... Won't stay @ this place for leisure - even with discount ! <s> The Sheraton Chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience Chicago . <s> There are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do ;  and there aren't even any shuttles that will bring you around town . <s> The food in the restaurant at the Hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries ;  and makes no attempt to emulate the Chicago culture . <s> There are a million other hotels in Chicago ;  and this is one of the most average . <s> The rooms are fairly decent sized ;  but they lack amenities like wi-fi and mini bars . <s> The view is nothing special ;  and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls . <s> We got an awesome deal through Priceline for a Friday - Sunday stay at  $ 75 for each night . <s> The hotel is very centrally located on Michigan Avenue  " The Magnificent Mile "  . <s> You can walk to a ton of shops  &  there are plenty of restaurants handy as well . <s> The hotel staff was very friendly ;  and the room itself was gorgeous . <s> Very modern decor . <s> Not drab  &  typical like most other chain hotels . <s> If staying in Chicago we definitely will be staying there again . <s> Price for valet parking overnight was insane  (  $ 42 / day )  ;  but what do you expect in a big city . <s> Millenium-My stay at the Millenium was amazing ! <s> Me and my husband came to Chicago for our anniversary ;  and there was a mess-up with our reservation ;  so we got upgraded to a superior room for free . <s> The location was excellent ;  since it allowed us to visit all the nearby museums and shopping centers without having to rent a taxi . <s> The bartender at the bar downstairs was very friendly ;  and introduced us to drinks we've never heard of before . <s> Thank you ! <s> Our room directly overlooked Lake Michigan ;  and it was very spacious ;  with an easy-access minibar and a very nice bathroom . <s> My only complaint is that the wireless is a little pricey ;  but other than that ;  it was an amazing stay ! <s> Will come back to again ! <s> I have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to Chicago . <s> It is a very nice hotel ;  and I will love to stay there if I visit Chicago again ! <s> There is a lot of positive to say about the hotel ;  staff is excellent ;  never experienced such an excellent service  --  that alone is worth coming back for . <s> Was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast . <s> A few things that could make this hotel even better ...  A hand shower in the bathroom . <s> The hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom ;  instead of the bathroom ;  when the bathroom is all damp after a shower I prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair . <s> Free internet access in the lobby . <s> I was surprised I had to pay 6 or 7 USD  ( for 15 minutes )  to log-on and check-in with my airline  ( only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying ?  !  ?  !  ?  !  ? <s>  )  <s> ï»¿Amalfi Hotel Chicago-I recently stayed there for 2 nights during my short visit to the University of Chicago . <s> Itâ€™s a little expensive since I booked it quite late but itâ€™s TOTALLY worth it ! <s> It is located in a great and safe neighborhood in downtown Chicago ;  within walking distance to the University of Chicago . <s> The bathroom is clean and housekeeping is awesome . <s> The complementary continental breakfast is conveniently served on every floor and provides delicious food . <s> Highly Recommend ! <s> I am writing about my recent stay at the Ambassador East Hotel . <s> I just wanted to let you know what a wonderful team you have working there . <s> Everyone from check-in to check-out couldn't have been more helpful or personable . <s> It made my mundane business trip a very pleasureable one . <s> The hotel is spotless ;  very comfortable and the restaurant is one of Chicago's finest . <s> You really offer the finest quality in both product and service . <s> The only complaint I have is that internet access is not free . <s> I would just like to mention one person in particular- Sofie . <s> She worked on the front desk and she went above and beyond to make my stay as smooth as possible . <s> She even helped me out with taxi services and local recommendations . <s> I shall look forward to returning next month . <s> Thank you . <s> Yours ;  P .  Grady <s> A perfect place for couples to get away too . <s> The location couldn't be better ; just three blocks from Navy Pier and Magnificent Mile . <s> It's really romantic ;  the service was awesome . <s> Very clean and quiet . <s> It has big rooms with comfortable atmosphere ;  huge bathroom . Over all ;  i had the a great experience there ;  would definitely stay there again ! <s> Was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time ....  1 . <s> Arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby ...  no warning . <s> not on the website ...   " thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site "  2 . <s> Lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area  ( 25 min wait )  ..  check in .. ACHE conference --  be prepared for the influx of people for the convention . <s> 3 . <s> Double book room ....  go back to check in ...  told to get back in line ...  and we will review when it is your turn ...  told them I just waited 25 mins ..  Curt service worker said wait your turn . <s> 4 . <s> Second room ...  dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3PM . <s> 5 . <s> Internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network ....  6 . <s> Second day and Third day stay ...  No hot Water to start the day off with cold shower ....  7 . <s> Check out ...  overcharge on bogus fees ....  Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont . <s> I had to write this review ! <s> My tired body walked through the doors of The Fairmont . <s> It felt like I walked through heaven's gates ;  the lobby was majestic and the staff was so friendly ;  that I was instantly energized . <s> The front desk staff was very helpful and quick to find my reservation and get my bags up to my room . <s> They were so nice to inform me of the health club and spa .. oh those wonderful spa treatments that are offered are incredible ;  I took advantage of a soothing pedicure during my visit  ( my very first )  as well as a massage . <s> I was amazed at the size of the meeting / conference room that we used for an afternoon . <s> The room was so clean and the bed was better than the one at home . <s> The food downstairs in the restaurant smelled so good that as tired as I was after the meeting ;  instead of room service ;  I went in ; and the food was mouth watering delicious ;  and the wait staff was very hospitable They take great pride in everything ;  even the wake up call was friendly . <s> My stay was so great ;  that I want to go back again soon ! <s> The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a magnificent grand hotel . <s> The size of the rooms ;  and the views of the city are phenomenal . <s> At night the city lights up ;  and the sight is majestic . <s> The hotel itself ;  and the employee's are wonderful ;  and well worth the pay to stay in such a place . <s> This Hotel has so much to offer ;  great dining ; a fantastic gym set up for those of us ;  who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing . My wife and I have just left recently ;  and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out . <s> Big thumbs up to Those who run that place ;  and helped us enjoy our stay . <s> I stayed at the Allegro for several days in August 2004 and I would defintely stay again . <s> I had a very large room with a huge bathroom ;  although the property is a converted theater so the rooms may vary in size and layout . <s> The lobby is comfortable with big sofas and chaise lounges ;  a nice place to enjoy the simple  ( 2 choices ;  no munchies )  but pleasant wine reception . <s> At night ;  there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity ;  other than theater traffic ;  but it's a short cab ride to Michigan Avenue shopping and River North restaurants . <s> The Homewood Suites is one of my favorite hotels in Chicago ! <s> It is a great place to stay as a family . <s> The last time my family and I visited Chicago ;  we stayed and picked the Shedd Aquarium package . <s> What an amazing time ! <s> The Aquarium is great ;  and we saved a lot of money by buying this package . <s> I also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen . <s> With two really picky children ;  it was so nice to be able to cook ;  or at least to have the option . <s> We also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the Homewood Suites Chicago Downtown . <s> Nice pool ;  great workout room ;  breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening . <s> I wouldn't stay anywhere else when I visit the Windy City ! <s> As a former Chicagoan ;  I'm appalled at the Amalfi Hotel Chicago . <s> First of all ;  I was expecting luxury and hospitality ;  neither of which I received . <s> There's an Experience Designer who is supposed to be like a  " personal concierge ;  "  but my experience with my ED was terrible . <s> I felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than I wanted to . <s> Not only that ;  but I couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast . <s> When I finally got to my room ;  I was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness . <s> I had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp . <s> On top of that ;  the bed was messily done ;  I could have done a better job on my own bed at home . <s> I was angry at this point ;  because I was paying a lot of money for every night I was staying at Amalfi ;  and I didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels . <s> I needed to use the Wi-Fi to download some important documents ;  and the internet was surprisingly slow . <s> Even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better ;  maybe even faster internet access . <s> When I finally checked out of the Amalfi ;  I made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems I'd had with my room and the hotel . <s> I was glad to see the Amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as I drove away ! <s> I had high hopes for the Hilton Chicago ;  but I am sad to say that I am disapointed . <s> Not only is it outrageously expensive  ( over  $ 200 for two people for one night )  ;  but they expect you to pay over  $ 40 to park your car ! <s> They do not offer free Wi-Fi ;  but instead I had to pay  $ 20 to get on the internet in my room . <s> I had to wait until 3 pm to check in  ( even though my flight was in the morning )  and I had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from . <s> After all of this stress ;  the Hilton Chicago didn't have an in hotel bar either . <s> I doubt I will stay here again ! <s> I have to thank the Ambassador East Hotel for providing a really great experience for my family . <s> We never leave our dog at home when we travel ;  and it's been a long time since we've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets . <s> The staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques . <s> My husband liked the fitness room . <s> It was nice and clean ;  with plenty of extra towels available . <s> It was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water ;  but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves . <s> We will definitely be staying here next time we visit Chicago . <s> We would make the trip just to stay here . <s> That's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel . <s> Superhigh Bill at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago My wife and I decided to take a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary . <s> I told my wife that I would take care of everything . <s> I booked the Millennium Knickerbocker because it had a great location ;  it was reasonably priced for a 4 star hotel and had spa features . <s> The hotel loby seemed nice enough and the staff seemed fine . <s> The problems for us started when we went to our room . <s> I have sinus problems ;  so I didn't notice the smell in our room ;  and my wife didn't say anything to me because she wanted to go with the flow and not ruin our weekend . <s> We couldn't find the remote for our television and we didn't call down ;  we were trying to be good sports . <s> We were both disappointed when we realized that our hotel didn't have a pool or hot tub ;  swimming and relaxing in a hot tub is one of the reasons we go on vacation . <s> Upon checking out I was hit was 250 dollar fee for smoking in our room . <s> My wife and I don't smoke and there was nothing we could do to get out of the smoking fee . <s> If that wasn't bad enough we were hit with a 50 fee for the missing remote control . <s> I have been 4 times in Chicago ;  and I have stayed in 4 different Hotels :  This has been for much the very best option . <s> The lobby ;  the warm of the receptionist ;  the room ;  the hotel is very good . <s> It is walking distance to the Magnificent Mile and there's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel . <s> If you like to travel with style this could be a very good option . <s> The room was big and luxurious ;  befitting the price tag  (  $ 299 )  . <s> Bed was very comfortable . <s> However ;  my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft ;  and I heard the elevators running all night . <s> Also held a one-day conference there for 25 people . <s> They stuck us in a long ;  narrow room that was cramped . <s> Also ;  the night before we had a pre-conference dinner at the Palm restaurant in the hotel . <s> Service was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served . <s> And the steaks were only so-so ;  a far cry from my experience with other Palms . <s> A very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms . <s> The decor was lovely . <s> My daughter and I spent 5-nights here ;  saw Wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town . <s> Was a bit disappointed with the bar / restaurant which opened and closed it's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours . <s> The room description boasted of safe's large enough to accomodate a laptop ;  so I brought mine . <s> I was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room  ( and not in mine )  . <s> As a side note ;  I was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area ...  even the 7-11 . <s> My stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Hotel was a short one ;  although ;  it was intended to be for five days ;  it only last two . <s> When me and my husband arrived we were met by a valet who knicked our Mercedez . <s> The clerk / concierge was on his phone for nearly 5 FULL minutes before he noticed that we were standing in front of him . <s> When we checked in ;  we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it . <s> We then returned to Lobby ;  and to our dismay ;  the hotel had Double Booked the room ! <s> After another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a  " better "  room . <s> The bed was unbearable ;  the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes  ( although it was supposedly a non-smoking room )  . <s> Too tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep . <s> However ;  it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room . <s> I needed an Ambien to go to sleep . <s> I woke up with backaches ;  the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day ;  and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room . <s> Me and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the Hyatt . <s> What was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in Chicago turned into a complete disaster . <s> The first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in ... they knew we had 6 ! <s> We ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel . <s> When we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other . <s> After some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor ;  unfortunately one of the rooms hadn't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around . <s> The staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating . <s> On our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5 : 30am . <s> Despite my calls to the front desk ;  the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes . <s> We also didn't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly . <s> One morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door . <s> I understand they allow pets ;  but really ... people need to clean up after their animals ... or have some dog free floors . <s> While Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms ;  their service was terrible ;  the staff was rude ;  and I still can't get over that dog poo in the hallway . <s> I definitely won't be staying here again . <s> Amalfi Hotel Chicago – I stayed here with friends and my experience was not quite good . <s> The room given to us was big enough but servicing was bad . <s> We dint get the ordered food on time and had to call them again to remind them . <s> Staffs were stubborn at times and we were quite unhappy with their behavior . <s> It was not worth staying here . <s> I don’t recommend this hotel unless you want to spend lot of money and get a bad service . <s> We attended a Bachorette Party in Chicago in Aug 2005 . <s> There were 10 girls total . <s> We had 5 rooms  ...  and I did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend . <s> Never been to Chi-town before ;  I booked our hotel based on reviews from TA . <s> And we were not disappointed . <s> The staff is wonderful ;  the happy hour was just fabulous . <s> The room was nice and clean ;  with a great double headed shower and Aveda products was an extra bonus ! <s> Then you also get free internet in your room ! <s> The hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness . <s> We still talk about what a wonderful time we had  ...  and we all agree that if we ever go back to Chicago we will be staying at the Amalfi again . <s> Trust me the pics don't do it justice ! <s> The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel . <s> The carpet was exceptionally worn ;  wallpaper peeling ;  bathroom grout dingy . <s> The place felt like it hadn't been redecorated in 30 years . <s> On top of that ;  the windows would not open  ( not unusual for a hig-rise hotel )  ;  and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work ;  I have no idea  ( they said 'radient cooling' whatever that is )  ;  but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation . <s> We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated . <s> So much for privacy . <s> I can't comment on the food ;  because we ate out at every chance . <s> Chicago has some fantastic food ! <s> And much of it within easy distance to the hotel . <s> The hotel is in a good location ;  near the waterfront and millenium park ;  shopping and dining . <s> The conference facilities were average ;  but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent . <s> I will never stay in this hotel again ;  especially for the price ;  because of the poor room quality . <s> For our anniversary this year ;  my wife and I stayed at the Conrad . <s> We're from the suburbs ;  so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us . <s> It's expensive ;  so we expect the best for our money . <s> This was most definitely not the best for our money . <s> It wasn't even a good deal either . <s> The problems began right off the bat . <s> When we got to our room ;  we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room . <s> It was like walking into a dusty attic . <s> When I sat down to watch TV ;  it turns out it wasn't even connected to cable or anything . <s> I kept changing the channel ;  but it was nothing but static and white noise . <s> I even looked for another remote . <s> After we left our things ;  we went out for a night in Chicago ;  but coming back ;  the smell seemed to have gotten worse . <s> I finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms . <s> They moved us to a different room ;  but they had no explanation for the smell . <s> For a single stay ;  that was more trouble than it was worth . <s> My family's seven day stay at the InterContinental Chicago hotel was more than I could ever imagine . <s> The InterContinental is more fantastic than any previous hotel I have visited ;  because of its wonderful amenities ;  such as the excellent 24 hour room service ;  access to personal trainers ; and even a dry cleaning service ;  just to mention a few . <s> My family really enjoyed dining on the contemporary American cuisine at the hotels Zest Restaurant ;  which served an excellent meal worth every dime of its reasonable price . <s> My most favorite point about the InterContinental Chicago is that it provides entry right into the Windy City ;  where my family and I had immediate access to transportation ;  shopping ;  and city attractions . <s> We had a great time traveling through Chicago and enjoying ourselves while at the same time we felt secure knowing that we had a nice ;  clean ;  elegant ;  safe hotel to travel back to whenever we were done touring the city each day . <s> The InterContinental is a must stay and I will recommend them to anyone who plans on visiting Chicago . <s> I recently stayed at The Talbott Hotel for 3 nights and I could not have been more disappointed . <s> It was a terrible experience . <s> Long wait to check into room since room wasn't ready even though I arrived way after the check in time . <s> Front desk was very rude . <s> Was given a smoking room when I had requested non-smoking . <s> Room service left a lot to be desired . <s> The food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing . <s> The staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly . <s> Had no toilet paper in room . <s> Room was very noisy . <s> Could hear people next door opening doors ;  watching tv ;  talking . <s> The room was very dingy ;  small and had a musty odor . <s> Needless to say I will not be staying here again nor will I be recommending this hotel to anyone else . <s> Stay away from this hotel . <s> Not worth the money . <s> This lovely hotel has only six floors ;  making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception . <s> The building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it . <s> Trump's huge new tower is just down the street . <s> The Amalfi looks recently refurbished ;  very modern ;  but warm and inviting . <s> Bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very ;  very comfortable beds . <s> Bathroom quite small but roomy enough ;  with Aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers . <s> Continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor . <s> Great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc  ( robes  &  slippers provided )  without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast . <s> Really enjoyed the Managers evening cocktail reception ;  especially the Amalfitinis . <s> A nice way to relax after a hard days' shopping ! <s> Location is great for all the shops ;  transport ;  museums etc . <s> Easy walking to everywhere . <s> Staff also very friendly and welcoming . <s> Would definately stay there again . <s> Home away from home ! <s> The suites are amazing with great views of the city . <s> The food is delious and served by an excellent staff . <s> I loved the heated pool on the top floor ;  very relaxing after a long day of meetings . <s> Great place to stay when your in Chicago ! <s> My first trip back to Chicago in about 7 years was perfect ! <s> I chose the Knickerbocker as I had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to Michigan Avenue ;  Rush Street and downtown Chicago . <s> I must say I was very impressed with the guestrooms ! <s> I had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what I've seen in photo's posted on the reviews . <s> The guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel ! <s> The beds are wonderful  --  I need to get a pillow top mattress at home ! <s> I used the Internet access with no issue and I LOVED the larger screen TV's . <s> The shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose . <s> And the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile . <s> I'm anxious to get back to Chicago and it won't be 7 years from now ! <s> I would highly recommend this hotel  --  fantastic guestrooms ;  location and staff ! <s> I've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one's I saw on previous reviews with the new renovation . <s> During my recent trip to Chicago ;  I stayed at the Ambassador East hotel ;  which is located in the downtown are . <s> I have to say I was not pleased with my stay there . <s> For one ;  I had requested that my room have one king sized bed when I called for reservations ;  however ;  when I arrived ;  the hotel lobby clerk said they did not have any king sized beds left and I had to settle with two double sized beds . <s> When I told the clerk that a king sized was promised when i made the reservation ;  he just shrugged his shoulders . <s> When I got to my room ;  I found it to be very small . <s> There was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room . <s> There wasn't ;  although I did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed . <s> At night ;  there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel . <s> I did not figure what the convention was for ;  but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise . <s> I called the front desk several times complaining about the noise . <s> Each time they assured me they would deal with the noise ;  but the racket never dissipated and I finally gave up getting any sleep . <s> I did go back to the lobby before my trip ended to complain of the poor service that they have given me ;  the manager said that she felt sorry for the trouble I had been having at the hotel ;  but did not offer any refund or consolation for the trouble . <s> When I left the Ambassador East ;  I vowed that if I ever returned to Chigaco ;  I would never stay at this place again . <s> The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is my favorite place to stay in Chicago ! <s> I travel to Chicago very often to visit my son ;  who is training for the U . S .  Navy . <s> They make every stay feel like a luxorius vacation . <s> The indoor pool and sauna are amazing ;  and I never have to miss a workout because the gym is fully equipped . <s> If you dine at the LB Bistro ;  you must try the Eggs Benedict  :  )  The staff are friendly and the prices are very reasonable for a hotel of this stature . <s> I just spent a week at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel and it was a very plesant stay . <s> When I first walked into the room it was very clean . <s> The bathroom was a decent size and the decorum was pleasant . <s> Room service was very good . <s> The view was amazing and I would recomend staying there . <s> The Omni Hotels ;  Chicago - Omni is an excellent place to stay . <s> It is located right off the Michigan Avenue which puts it in a central location and it is also located pretty close to the airport . <s> The staff is very pleasant and the decor is amazing . <s> The rooms have pleasing aesthetics and the in-room luxuries aare apt for a 5-star hotel . <s> The bathrooms are big and clean which I particularly like about the rooms . <s> The room-service is a little late at times but usually pretty satisfactory . <s> In addition to this ;  the food is amazing which makes it worth for the wait . <s> The gym is absolutely state-of-the-art ;  as is the spa and the swimming pool . <s> Definitely a place to be more than once . <s> I would recommend this hotel over any other in Chicago <s> When I went to The James hotel in Chicago I truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising . <s> Gorgeous chairs ;  staff at the desk focusing on their job ;  and a clean ;  well decorated hotel room . <s> Much to my ;  and my wallet's dismay I found quite the opposite . <s> I arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed ;  and found the clerk reading a magazine . <s> It must have been a fascinating article ;  as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if I had a reservation ;  or would be making one . <s> I said I had one ;  and gave him the voucher I'd printed out . <s> He checked it ;  and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out ;  he went on to say that I would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if I wished to stay the night . <s> I grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and I desperately needed to get some sleep . <s> The clerk offered to walk me to my room ;  saying I looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after I got some sleep . <s> I accepted ;  and followed him to my new room . <s> He carried the briefcase I had with me ;  but it was not apparent why at the time as I had both hands free . <s> He ushered me into my room ;  setting the briefcase down inside ;  and said if I needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything . <s> I thanked him and closed the door . <s> It was then that I looked around and fully saw where I was staying . <s> What was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6 "  apart ;  covered in ruffled blankets and sheets . <s> The cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently . <s> A quick look around the other areas and I found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap ;  not even the complementary ones were left behind . <s> I got ready for bed ;  and looked around for the TV remote ;  which it turned out ;  had no batteries in it . <s> Instead ;  I just turned out the lights and rolled over ;  sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option . <s> In the morning I walked down to the lobby and asked to check out . <s> I'd had enough of the hotel after one night . <s> The clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill . <s>  $ 240 for my room ;  and an extra  $ 80 with a note about a baggage service . <s> I asked her about it ;  and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service . <s> I asked if it was considered reasonable to charge  $ 80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up ;  and riding the elevator ;  and she said it was unusual ;  but not unheard of . <s> She offered to change it to a  " mere "   $ 20 and handed me a slip with a phone number ;  name ;  and reason for the disagreement ;  saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and I after I signed it . <s> I did so ;  and left ;  my wallet  $ 260 lighter ;  and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep . <s> Stays here while on a business trip in Chicago . <s> First off the staff were very friendly and helpful . <s> They were knowledgeable about the things in the area when I needed to find something . <s> I had a king bed room - it was very clean and cozy and the view was great . <s> This is definitely a hotel I will stay at again if my work takes me back to Chicago . <s> Very beautiful hotel . <s> The historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing . <s> This hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which I enjoyed the spacious ;  tidy rooms . <s> The staff here are very friendly ;  helpful ;  and professional . <s> The concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel . <s> I especially enjoyed the service at The Lockwood Restaurant here . <s> Our server was excellent and the food was delicious ! <s> I must say this hotel exceeded my expectations . <s> All in all ;  my stay was awesome ! <s> Overall the hotel is very nice . <s> The rooms are spacious and well-appointed ;  but they tend to be aging or dated . <s> My bathroom was particularly below average ;  with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead . <s> The toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed . <s> The conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant . <s> I hate it when they do that- it makes me suspect they're getting kickbacks from places that otherwise don't get enough business on their own . <s> Breakfast was very good . <s> It's a relatively large european-style spread . <s> HiltonChicago â€“ Very convenient location ;  within walking distance of the Field Museum and the lake . <s> Room was spacious and clean ;  but smelled slightly of dog . <s> Room service was quick ;  I recommend trying the omelets . <s> Just got back from 2 days up in Chicago shopping with girlfriends . <s> First time I have stayed at the Omni . <s> I did so because I saw a  $ 129 . 00 rate that included  $ 25 . 00 of free food on Travelzoo . <s> The three of us  ( 55 year olds )  all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a VERY comfortable pull out sofa . <s> We had plenty of room . <s> Food in the restaurant was great ;  service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with ;  early morning delivery of free coffee ;  juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat ;  time of movies ;  shopping areas ;  etc was really helpful . <s> Need I mention the outstanding location ? <s> Simply the best ! <s> We all decided that the Omni is our new favorite hotel . <s> I absolutely loved staying at the Swissotel Chicago . <s> The entire hotel has such an elegant and luxurious feel to it . <s> The room was absolutely stunning ! <s> First of all ;  it was so spotless and clean . <s> The design of it was beautiful ! <s> There was gorgeous artwork on the walls even . <s> The design was very modern and above average for hotel decor . <s> There was a separate bath and separate shower which I loved ! <s> There was a huge LCD flat screen TV and high speed wireless Internet available . <s> There was even an iPod docking station which was great for listening to music and so convenient since I brought my iPod with me ! <s> The view from the window of Chicago was beautiful too . <s> The service was very quick and everyone was very friendly . <s> I didn't have any problems at all but if I did I'm sure the customer service at the hotel would have had it fixed very quick I could tell their top priority was the guests happiness and satisfaction ! <s> There were even two restaurants in the hotel and a lounge ! <s> I can't wait to go back to this hotel . <s> It felt like I was on a luxurious vacation ! <s> On our visit to Chicago ;  we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown ;  within walking distance to most major attractions ;  such as Sears Tower ;  Magnificent Mile ;  Grant / Millenium Parks ;  etc . <s> Subway  &  bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city  . <s> Overall the hotel was very nice ;  clean ;  and at a great location . <s> Was in a safe area . <s> Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play . <s> I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again ! <s> I would NOT recommend staying at the Swissotel in Chicago . <s> I was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times . <s> She had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since I would be arriving first . <s> The  " night manager "  at the hotel was extremely rude and told me I could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation . <s>  ( this was THEIR mistake )  They told me I could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived . <s> They did nothing to try and help me until I stood there and complained for twenty minutes . <s> I can't believe that a  " manager "  would treat a customer this way . <s> There are other great hotels in Chicago . <s> This hotel is not worth the aggravation ! <s> We arrived and thought for  $ 350 a night ;  it would be a decent place . <s> Good reviews ; etc ...  We arrived to find that the website pictures were misleading . <s> The hotel lounge was a  " room "  ;  it was really odd and very dark . <s> The first night there I noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking . <s> Resembled something you'd find on a street . <s> To top it all off we woke up after night  # 2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us . <s> My husband and I were both bitten . <s> I was bitten WAY more than my husband . <s> My legs were covered with bites . <s> I was on ointments and Benadryl for over a week . <s> I immediately came home and scalded all our clothes . <s> There was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it . <s> The bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub . <s> The view in room  # 607 is of a roof . <s> Not good . <s> The stay was VERY disappointing . <s> The only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor . <s> My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park . <s> What I expected to be a very pleasant experience ;  turned out to be a stressful visit . <s> We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation . <s> Upon arrival ;  the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful . <s> As we had no other options ;  we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds . <s> I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong ! <s> There wasn't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I cannot help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out . <s> To add insult to injury ;  the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation  --  something I think they should be specifically trained to do  --  and did not offer any compensation ;  partial refund or related  " perk "  to make up for our great inconvenience . <s> Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do ! <s> Although we paid for the breakfast package ;  we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense . <s> Pardon the pun ;  but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel's lack of customer service ! <s> I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but ;  thus far ;  we have received no satisfaction . <s> Needless to say ;  we will not be visiting this property again ! <s> In fact ;  we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels . <s> For a hotel rated with four diamonds by AAA ;  one would think the Hilton Chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty . <s> The only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare . <s> I should have known from the moment I walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth . <s> First off ;  as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldn't be any older than nineteen or twenty ;  red flags started going up . <s> The clerk was extremely rude and lazy ;  acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone . <s> If that wasn't bad enough ;  the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife's breasts . <s> She wasn't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat . <s> After diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys . <s> It shouldn't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break . <s> Okay ;  that was annoying ;  but we managed easy enough . <s> We finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip . <s> To our surprise ;  not to mention our disgust and horror ;  their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out . <s> It took almost a half hour between the couple in the room ;  the front desk ;  and my wife and me to get it straightened out . <s> Apparently the night clerk didn't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk . <s> After what could only be described as chaos ;  we were finally given another room on the next floor up . <s> We were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while I dropped our luggage by the beds . <s> Hearing a clinking sound I bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed . <s> I was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when I heard my wife cry out . <s> There on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and I noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there . <s> There ;  in the sink and in very plain sight ;  was a used condom ! <s> So far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back . <s> By then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room ;  free of charge to make up for our troubles . <s> The room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around . <s> Despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had ;  we decided to make due . <s> So while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip I pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access . <s> I shouldn't have even bothered as I've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds I was getting . <s> With a quick call to the desk I was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment . <s> So instead of worrying about it ;  we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area . <s> Yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife's chest or forgot half of our order . <s> After arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything ;  we found that our found was not only bland ;  it was cold ! <s> We didn't even bother trying anything else ;  that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel . <s> I don't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldn't clean a room ;  but I know that that hotel didn't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative . <s> That place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel . <s> Hilton Chicago - Not worth the price . <s> Our room on the second floor was very noisy due to traffic . <s> The windows faced the street ;  and we couldn't even see the harbor . <s> The loop was much farther than expected . <s> It wound up being an hour walk round trip . <s> Fairmont Hotels are generally my preferred choice ;  but this was a true disappointment . <s> Check-in was quite slow and problematic  ( glitches with their reservation system locally )  . <s> Room was very small and oddly arranged . <s> Felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk . <s> Hotel overall felt quite cold and isolating ... lobby is not at all inviting ;  and it didn't feel terribly safe walking around outside . <s> Gift shop was overpriced ;  even for a downtown hotel . <s> Food was disappointing . <s> Overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of A Fairmont i've come to count on . <s> Bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out . <s> {\rtf1\ansi\ansicpg1252\cocoartf1187\cocoasubrtf370 {\fonttbl\f0\fswiss\fcharset0 Helvetica ; } {\colortbl ; \red255\green255\blue255 ; } \margl1440\margr1440\vieww10800\viewh8400\viewkind0 \pard\tx720\tx1440\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\tx5040\tx5760\tx6480\tx7200\tx7920\tx8640\pardirnatural  \f0\fs24 \cf0 Ambassador East - My stay at this hotel was a bit disappointing despite all its 5-star reviews . <s> The front desk staff had an attitude and was impatient about us asking questions about various details of the hotel and the neighborhood . <s> Very upsetting especially after a long flight . <s> } <s> There were many positives when staying in this hotel at the north end of the Magnificant Mile . <s> The rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with great attention to detail . <s> The quality of service was excellent ;  the staff professional ;  and the location was perfect . <s> There are great views of Chicago from many of the rooms . <s> The staff seemed to care about the quality of my stay from the moment I was greeted upon arrival to the moment I got in my taxi to leave . <s> There is a nice rooftop bar / restaurant perfect for a lite meal or a refreshing cocktail with great views of the city . <s> There really weren't any negatives and I would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone staying in the Chicago area . <s> Stayed here for one night in June ;  but have stayed here before when on business in Chicago . <s> Great location for business / shopping / sightseeing . <s> In between Michigan Avenue's Magnificent Mile and the Loop and next to the Chicago River . <s> Rooms very spacious and clean . <s> Gym has a wonderful view ;  as it is situated on the top of the hotel . <s> Bar next to lobby ;  very busy with good atmosphere . <s> Cannot fault the hotel . <s> Prefer it to the Westin - my previous address when in Chicago . <s> We stayed two nights . <s> We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant . <s> He was very cold . <s> Our room was very ;  very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days . <s> The room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet . <s> We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink ;  the door to the bar was locked . <s> We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasn't and were told they were short staffed ;  'sorry' . <s> WHAT ?  ? <s> are you running here ? <s> You are a hotel in the country's third largest city and your amenities are open at whim ? <s> This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel . <s> This hotel does not belong in the same league as The Peninsula ;  Four Seasons ;  or Ritz Carlton . <s> It was more like staying at an overpriced W Hotel . <s> Staff was very nice and attentive ;  but the lobby is cramped ;  and only two small elevators for 17 floors !  ! <s> Several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor ;  and we were forced to take the stairs . <s> The hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews . <s> when i first checked the hotel's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there . <s> but i was totally disappointed once i got there ;  first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor  ;  and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one ;  it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that . <s> then when i was trying to enjoy the view ;  they windows were all dusty and dirty . <s> so i decided to get out of the room  ;  and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture  . <s> so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse !

<s> Stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for 3 nights in early April 2007 . <s> Very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the Golden Mile . <s> Good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice French twist . <s> Dinner at the restaurant was also good . <s> Prices are reasonable . <s> Room is comfortable ;  only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening . <s> Excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff . <s> Would definitely stay here again if visiting Chicago . <s> Concierge recommended a small van tour ;  which was excellent . <s> However early April is too early to visit Chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of Chicago was not operating yet . <s> We stayed in the Conrad for 4 nights just before Thanksgiving . <s> We had a corner room overlooking N Michigan Av and the Tribune Building . <s> To say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful . <s> The staff were unbelievably helpful . <s> The standard of the room was superb - HD plasma screens ;  luxury bedlinens ;  iPod radio ;  huge bathroom . <s> Location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole Light Festival parade from the window . <s> Breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service . <s> Would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5 . <s> I have to admit ;  I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia ;  but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago ;  my fears were slightly assuaged . <s> A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before ;  and had nothing but positive things to say . <s> With this new-found optimism in mind ;  I went forward on my journey in confidence . <s> I have to say ;  I was not let down . <s> From the moment I stepped into the lobby ;  I felt at home . <s> The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms ;  and the check-in process was fast and efficient . <s> The rooms themselves are incredibly homey ;  feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion . <s> The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels ;  really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago ;  and provided a secure place to stay at night ;  or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group . <s> Of course ;  the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel . <s> I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building . <s> Overall it's very cozy ;  and has a certain old-world feeling to it ;  once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times . <s> It was never overwhelmingly crowded ;  and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly ;  yet not intrusive . <s> I don't usually enjoy staying in hotels ;  but I love the Allegro Chicago ! <s> I went to Chicago on business last year and I had the pleasure of staying at the luxurious Hyatt Regency Hotel . <s> I opted for the Business Plan ;  although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from ;  such as the Allergy Friendly ;  Monarch Suite ;  State Suite ;  all the way up to the Presidential Suite . <s> My suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort ;  equipped with Wi-Fi ;  a generous 37 inch television ;  spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body . <s> I dined at the Stetson's Chop Shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared . <s> The staff was curtious and accommodating . <s> For breakfast ;  I opted to have my meal brought to my room where I started my business day over a delicious hot meal and strong ;  gourmet coffee . <s> I would highly recommend this wonderful haven to anyone planning an overnight Chicago stay . <s> My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown ;  so he chose the Amalfi Hotel ;  located conveniently to everything we needed . <s> This place was phenomenal !  !  ! <s> He chose a romantic getaway package ;  as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever . <s> The hotel is super clean and very chic ;  the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb . <s> We were able to bring along our dog ;  which was also really important to us . <s> The first day we were there ;  we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple's massage . <s> The masseuses come straight to your room so it's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great . <s> After our massages ;  we went to the Keefer Steakhouse ;  which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic . <s> They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill ;  which was nice as well . <s> In all ;  our 3 nights there were pretty similar ;  we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there ;  I've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City . <s> Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay . <s> Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift ;  but everything else made up for that . <s> Positives :  Bed was very comfortable ;  great to have real shower ;  free internet ;  gym usage ;  staff  ( all friendly )  and location . <s> Negative :  Lift noise ;  lifts slow and restaurant  ( there are so many great restaurants around - don't bother staying in )  Would stay again ! <s> This hotel is rather stupid to be frank . <s> It's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional . <s> The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn't much in them . <s> I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink . <s> I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days . <s> It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything . <s> I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b / c the bathroom doors aren't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan ! <s> It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night . <s> On a good note ;  the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean . <s> That's about the only good thing I can say about this place . <s> I would not go back . <s> My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro ! <s> The room was so small . <s> The bathroom was ridiculously stupid ;  everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself . <s> Truly one person at time in the bathroom ;  it was like being in an airplane's bathroom . <s> The walls are so thin ;  we heard the people across hall having sex . <s> The some staff were really rude . <s> I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out . <s> Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating  "  do not disturb . <s>  "  The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms ;  no mini fridge ;  and no coffee maker either . <s> NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny . <s> We were there for four days and three nights ;  so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at . <s> I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car . <s> My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again !  !  ! <s> in the windy city  ; this is a very good place . amazing rooms and service . everything is a walking distance  . An absolute must for business trio as ease with which you can conduct and schedule meetings here is unbeatable . <s> Good decor and impishly modern <s> My husband and I recently went to Chicago for my Aunt's funeral . <s> We are not familiar with the area so we asked for recommedations of where to stay for the two nights we would be in town . <s> We were told to stay at the Ambassador East Hotel . <s> I wish we could say that our experience there was a good one ;  but sadly ;  it was one of of the more disappointing travel experiences we have had . <s> Upon check in we were quickly shown to our rooms ;  but when we entered our king suite a very strong ;  musty smell greeted us on the other side . <s> At first I thought I was just being sensitive ;  but after about an hour in the room we simply had to request to be moved . <s> The smell was too overwhelming . <s> The front desk said they would be happy to move us ;  but the only other room available was a suite with two double beds ;  rather than the king bed suite we originally reserved . <s> While this was not exactly what we wanted ;  we didn't really have a choice to refuse . <s> After transfering to the new room and getting settled ;  we discovered that the electrical outlet near the sink in the bathroom did not work . <s> While this did not bother my husband too much ;  I was very annoyed ;  as I need the mirror while I use my hair dryer ;  curling iron ;  etc . <s> I absolutely did not want to have to switch rooms yet again ;  so I simply had to make due with doing my hair next to the bed . <s> They also only gave us two towels of any kind in the bathroom ;  so we had to request washcloths and small hand towels ;  BOTH DAYS we were there ! <s> Each time the housekeeping staff seemed incredibly annoyed at these requests . <s> For what we paid to stay at this hotel ;  we were not impressed at all . <s> The customer service was lackluster and the rooms were not up to par . <s> If you are ever in Chicago ;  do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else . <s> Great Hotel ! <s> The staff is friendly ;  corteous ;  and professional . <s> They made me feel like I was a returning guest which I was not  ( but I will be !  )  . <s> The rooms were very clean and I slept well in the comfy bed . <s> They have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that I took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside . <s> My only issue was the battery for the TV remote died . <s> However ;  a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about 2 minutes ! <s> 5 stars !  !  ! <s> I stayed at the InterContinental in Chicago for my visit to set up my Daughter's wedding . <s> Nina  ( Our Daughter )  stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched ! <s> Well I don't understand why at all . <s> Upon arrival we checked in and met Nina at the  " The Bar "   ( how innovative )  and had a light supper . <s> The food was like airline food and cold . <s> The waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet . <s> When he finally came with the check we thought  " our light supper "  was all too pricey . <s> Then we were supposed to meet the sales manager Erin in the Lobby at 8 : 00 PM sharp . <s> Not sharp enough . <s> At 8 : 15 a worker came over to us and stated that Erin had an emergency and wouldn't be able to meet with us tonight . <s> Well that is just great . <s> Over  $ 300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted . <s> No more money will be spent here ;  I will Guarentee that . <s> Sincerely Mr .  and Mrs .  Scott Grander Louisville ;  KY <s> We stayed 6 pleasent days in this not too big and very friendly hotel . <s> the rooms were spotless comfortable and great view too ...  also nice view from the roof-bar . <s> The area is pleasant nice and clean ;  minute walk to magnificant mile ;  easy to walk around to the lake . <s> friendly stuff ;  very clean ;  great warm hotel to stay in . <s> it does not have the  " big hotel "  factory-like feeling - more like home  :  )  <s> My family booked five nitghts at the Omni Chicago for our upcoming spring break . <s> We took advantage of a pre-paid ;  non-cancellable offer . <s> We subsequently received a  " Bed  &  Breakfast "  offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation  ( same dates ;  different offer )  . <s> We called the 800' number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant ;  we simply hung up . <s> We had been looking forward to our vacation ;  but now I am not sure I made the right choice with this hotel . <s> I should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the Ritz ;  the Four Seasons ;  and the Peninsula would have never treated us this way . <s> I will post again after our stay on April 17th . <s> I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel this past summer for 5 days and it was the worst hotel experience I have ever had ! <s> Firstly ;  the sheets that were on the bed seemed as if they were the same ones the previous guests had left on there ;  they looked dingy or just plain dirty . <s> Second ;  I went to function one night and came back in late so I was really tired the next morning ;  hence I slept in late . <s> I put the  " Do Not Disturb "  sign on my door and the room service still came knocking down my door asking if they can come and clean . <s> Obviously ;  the room service lady can't read . <s> Third ;  and worst of them all ;  when I checked I was only allowed valet parking so I gave up my keys hoping to get back my car in one piece . <s> Well ;  the next morning when I asked for my car to be retrieved ;  there was a big dent in the driver's door of my 2010 Mustang ! <s> I was livid and the valet guy was insisting that he got it like that . <s> In the end I had to get my door repaired on my own ! <s> The only thing I liked there was the food and it wasn't even all that . <s> I was so disappointed and so I'm warning everyone to think twice before you make a reservation . <s> This hotel does not live up to the reviews . <s> The room was larger than I expected . <s> However ;  the decor was a bit dated . <s> The bedding was ripped ;  carpet was stained ;  and the shower door was broken . <s> There was a long wait to the elevators ;  and if you're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym . <s> The main issue I had was the attitude I received from the staff . <s> There was literally only ONE nice person at the front desk . <s> There are no ice machines in this building ;  so you have to request it from the front desk . <s> One day I requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person . <s> 20 minutes later I made a follow up call because I did not receive my ice . <s> I was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and I should just wait . <s> I finally got the ice 10 minutes later . <s> Two days later I requested ice again . <s> Waited 30 minutes and just gave up . <s> While I was leaving ;  I mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said  " I didn't get a call for ice . <s>  "  Well I obviously wasn't making it up ;  lady ! <s> I called and spoke with someone . <s> She didn't even apologize or offer me anything . <s> Overall ;  I would not recommend this hotel . <s> There are so many hotels in the Chicago area . <s> Choose a different one . <s> I recently had the opportunity to stay at the Conrad Chicago Hotel ;  located on North Rush Street . <s> As part of the Hilton hotel chain ;  I was confident that I would have a positive experience . <s> Unfortunately ;  from the time I walked in the door until the time I checked out ;  I was plagued with nothing but problems . <s> When I walked into the hotel ;  I was not greeted by the concierge ;  which is usually a bad sign . <s>  ( He was reading a newspaper . <s>  )  Then ;  when I announced that I was holding a reservation ;  they desk clerk was unable to find it . <s> I had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system ;  but they could not find the room I had reserved . <s> Finally ;  they assigned me a room ;  but it was smaller than I had originally requested and it had a bad odor . <s> I was very disappointed with the room and its decor . <s> The room smelled of stale smoke ;  even though it was on a non-smoking floor . <s> The bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom . <s> I had to keep checking to make sure I was really at the Conrad Chicago . <s> Surely ;  this was not the way the Hilton chain operates ! <s> There continued to be problem throughout my stay . <s> I asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late ;  which had me scurrying around so I could make my business meeting . <s> I ordered breakfast to be brought to my room ;  and it never showed up  --  at all ! <s> And the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm ;  so my shower was short and unsatisfying . <s> I decided to check out of the Conrad Chicago a day earlier than originally planned because I was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues . <s> Upon my return home ;  I wrote a letter to the hotel manager ;  but never received a reply . <s> Because they refused to acknowledge that I had problems ;  I will not be staying at the Conrad Chicago again ;  and will avoid all Hilton Hotels in the future . <s> Millennium –I stayed at the Millennium in Chicago for a few days last month . <s> Unfortunately ;  it wasn’t the luxury vacation I was hoping for . <s> Things started off kind of rocky right from when I checked in . <s> The hotel didn’t have my Hotwire reservation on record . <s> Then when I ordered room service for dinner it took over an hour for them to deliver my food . <s> Though the accommodations were pretty nice ;  it wasn’t worth the steep price I was paying for my suite . <s> Our experience at Hotel Monaco was wonderful . <s> My fiancee and I stayed two nights in the Tranquility suite -- absolutely exquisite ! <s> We had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room . <s>  ( Except to go to the gym  :  )  I was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room ! <s> I was surprised by that . <s> This hotel was the definition of 'luxury' ;  they had anything we needed and more . <s> My fiancee said we were staying at a really 'nice' hotel but I had no idea until we walked in the door . <s> As soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor . <s> I have to admit ;  cheesy as it may sound ;  I felt like a queen all weekend long  :  )  Most of the time I have at least one problem with the hotel I stayed at ;  but I have to say at this point I have no complaints at all about Hotel Monaco and I will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to Chicago . <s> I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter . <s> I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels . <s> I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation . <s> Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way . <s> I booked the hotel stay for over a week ;  which was very expensive ;  and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL ;  despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well ! <s> They did nothing to accommodate me ;  and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she  " didn't know the area "  To tope it all off ;  the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it . <s> Worst hotel experience of my life ;  I will never go back . <s> - Sandy D .  <s> The Hilton family would be outraged after hearing about a recent stay  ( i . e . <s> nightmare )  at the Palmer House Hilton . <s> I arrived 3 days before the National Restaurant Association tade show hoping to beat the crowds and settle in for a long week of trade show business . <s> When I arrived I was greeted or really snarled at by the Clerk . <s> This lady  ( if one can really call this beast that )  was aggressive and rude from the get go . <s> She made a snide comment on the number of bags I had and it was downhill from there . <s> My guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that I had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation . <s> I informed  " Brenda "  that I had never cancelled my reservation . <s> We had originally booked 2 rooms  ( one for me and one for colleague )  and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later . <s> She huffed and puffed and finally said ;  oh okay ;  I read it wrong but we don't have a room for you . <s> My room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day . <s> As a Hilton Honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain ;  I was furious . <s> She said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked . <s> She left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes ;  coming back with a smirk on her face . <s> She informed me that I had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100 %  . <s> The first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the Chicago downtown ;  closer to the airport or that I could go with another room they had ;  a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days . <s> I was outraged . <s> No ;  I'm sorry and certainly the options were horrible . <s> I ended up taking the smoking room where I barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells . <s> Additionally ;  there was no upgrade at all during my stay there . <s> I was not offered anything to make up for my troubles ;  their screw-up nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call . <s> The net outcome :  I will NEVER stay at this hotel again and I'm thinking of shredding my Hilton Honors card . <s> Don't make the mistake of dealing with this property . <s> You will be very ;  very sorry . <s> Thanks for reading all this . <s> Hopefully it will help someone out there before booking at this joke of a hotel . <s> Great hotel !  ! <s> The staff is very friendly and helpful . <s> The room was in perfect shape ;  very clean and just a beautiful setup . <s> I will definetly go to this hotel many more times when i am in the area ! <s> I would definetly recommend it ! <s> Having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website ;  I arrived tired from Ireland ;  to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night ;  but did have rooms for the rest of the week . <s> They booked me in to another  ( not as nice )  downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation . <s> On my return to the hotel next day ;  I was upgraded to the Club level . <s> What really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake ... unprompted . <s> Of course ;  the hotel itself  ( particularly on the 32nd floor )  is excellent . <s> I will definitely be back . <s> During my recent stay at the Hyatt Regency Chicago ;  I was severely disappointed in the quality of the facility and its staff . <s> To start off ;  the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms . <s> Hoping to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings ;  I had hoped to spend a quiet night in . <s> My neighbors ;  however ;  watching what I can only imagine was a Real House Wives of New Jersey marathon on full volume ;  destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance . <s> When I asked the concierge to address the issue ;  he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job . <s> As I visited the gym ;  I found their  " state-of-the-art "  StayFitTM gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills ;  weights and yoga mats . <s> The water in the cooler was quite warm ;  and the workout towels were stained and tattered . <s> Finally ;  all the hypo-allergenic features touted on their website were rendered null by the presence of dust balls under the beds . <s> Hilton Chicago - I stayed at Hotel Hilton in Chicago in June last year ;  when I was on a holiday with friends . <s> It was a very disappointing experience . <s> We reached close to midnight and there was no one at the reception area to attend to us although we had pre-booked our rooms online a week before the arrival . <s> We had to wait for almost an hour before we finally checked-in . <s> The rooms were unkempt and the beds were not organized . <s> It was shocking to find the sheets on the bed dirty and our request to get them changed was not answered for a couple hours . <s> The television set in the room although was a latest model simply did not work . <s> The bathroom attached along with the room was not up to the mark and looked unhygienic . <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone and will definitely not come back . <s> I accompanied my husband on a business trip to Chicago back in September and we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel . <s> The place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm ! <s> Also ;  there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance ;  so I shopped while my husband worked . <s> It just doesn't get any better than that ! <s> I loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel ;  and I'd definitely stay there again ! <s> The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure . <s> Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable ;  but the food in the restaurant was exquisite . <s> Not to mention the perfect service from the resort's employees ! <s> I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs . <s> I'm naturally a fitness freak ;  so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor . <s> Best of all ;  it was available to guests at any time ;  day or night . <s> The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area ;  so it wasn't a far walk to scope out the shops . <s> The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up . <s> It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life . <s> I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave . <s> Any time that I make my way back to Chicago ;  you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago . <s> I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling . <s> This place is a dump . <s> I booked on Priceline ;  because the last time I booked a Priceline hotel in Chicago ;  I got the Westin and loved it . <s> Despite having paid for Priceline ;  I ate the money I had already spent and called for a reservation at the Westin and went there for the weekend ;  instead . <s> I didn't regret it for a second . <s> You will be disappointed if you stay at the Millenium Knickerbocker because you are paying for a Holiday Inn at the price of a Westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more . <s> The location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive . <s> There are enough hotels near the loop  ( and near a train / bus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively )  that you should not spend the money on the Millenium . <s> Do not waste your time and stay here -- this is a trap because of its location ;  but it's not worth it . <s> Really . <s> great hotel . <s> went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time . <s> The hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at . <s> Beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery . <s> Great staff and wonderfull food as well ;  i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work . <s> I was very satisfied after staying at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower . <s> The service was excellent ;  as the staff was very helpful and polite . <s> The beds were very comfortable ;  and the rooms were very spacious . <s> I will definitely be returning to this hotel . <s> My initial thought of the hotel was ;  this place is just ok ;  I didnt look up any reviews as I was staying there with 2 other friends . <s> I was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room . <s> Views were good ;  its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located . <s> I'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is HUGE . <s> I love all the space they have . <s> Flat tv ;  traditional seating and I admired the fabric-based headboards . <s> Those are very nice ! <s> Walking distance to restaurants were convenient . <s> I'm a highly frequent traveler to Chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives . <s> In any event ;  I'd recommend staying at the Monaco again ! <s> I was very disappointed with the hotel this time . <s> They seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit . <s> The clientele also seem to be of a lower quality . <s> The lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice . <s> The house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee ;  she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room . <s> I think I will have to stay with the InterContinental next time . <s> I vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009 . <s> The room ;  the bathroom ;  the view ;  and the staff were all wonderful . <s> I just wish the hotel were a few blocks North  ( on MI Ave )  . <s> Sometimes ;  when you're tired ;  that extra couple of blocks seem like miles ! <s> I stayed at the the Conrad Chicago Hotel last winter with my family and I couldn't be happier with are choice . <s> The staff was very polite and helpfull and the rooms were very comfortable and felt like home . <s> I loved the area of chicago the hotel was in there wasnt alot of crim around and i felt safe being in a new city . <s> I would never stay here again . <s> For a hotel that calls itself a four-diamond hotel ;  it cannot even provide the most basic amenities and services . <s> I would have been more comfortable staying in a run-down motel . <s> The bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained . <s> -Review of the Hard Rock Hotel- I find that the Hard Rock Hotel ;  located in Chicago ;  has extrodinary scenary . <s> The hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking . <s> Hungry ? <s> Visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables . <s> The hotel also host events such as ballet ;  fun in the bar and a dj to name a few . <s> This hotel is definitely worth your while . <s> I will most definitely visit again . <s> Book your reservation as soon as possible and don't forget your camera ! <s> I recently stayed at the Hotel Monaco and I must say ;  it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city . <s> In the past ;  I've always stayed at the Marriott or the Hilton so this time I thought I'd go with a boutique hotel . <s> I've stayed at some of the Kimpton properties in San Francisco so I was delighted that they are running the Monaco . <s> Basically ;  I like the friendly ;  real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places I've used before . <s> I do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill I normally use . <s> South Water Kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants . <s> I really dug the complimentary coffee ;  high speed internet and newspaper . <s> I get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the Monaco offered a bunch of freebies  --  especially liked the afternoon wine service . <s> All in all ;  I will return to the Monaco . <s> It's a great alternative . <s> My wife and I stayed at this hotel at the end of May ;  2009 . <s> She came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city . <s> We got a deal on this hotel through TravelZoos . <s>  $ 249 / night stay for  $ 99 / night plus we got the full buffet breakfast . <s> The room was wonderful . <s> Extremely large King size bed with expansive sitting area . <s> We are used to smaller hotels with little room to move . <s> The bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows . <s> No wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit  ( poor taps )  . <s> We could have upgraded to river view for  $ 20 / night but chose not to . <s> We enjoyed the room for what it was . <s> 22nd floor looking south . <s> The buffet breakfast was great . <s> Lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs ;  non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please . <s> Great to have breakfast included in night stay . <s> Might be a bit dear to pay at  $ 22 / person . <s> It was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast ;  coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal . <s> Concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat ;  always informative and ready to provide maps ;  directions ;  multiple suggestions and even make the reservations . <s> Cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs . <s> Location was great . <s> Blocks from El and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river . <s> If in Chicago again ;  would not hesitate to stay here again . <s> A swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it . <s> We didn't stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room . <s> Saying that ;  we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking . <s> Hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that won't have a car . <s> Not a family frienly hotel . <s> Dining tip :  Long walk from hotel Gino's pizza is a must have !  ! <s> Worth the walk . <s> Many things in between hotel and Gino's to do so you can break up the walk . <s> Talbott Hotel - Talbott hotel is like our home away from home . <s> Whenever we visit chicago ;  we stay there only . <s> It is close to Michigan Ave and the famed Water Tower . <s> The price is an excellent factor considering the amenities provided . <s> During our last stay ;  the staff was very helpful ;  they upgraded our room to king size considering our repetitive stay . <s> The rooms are spacious ;  clean and bright . <s> I would highly recommend Talbott . <s> What a fabulous hotel ! <s> From its location directly on the Magnificant Mile and surrounded by the finest shopping ;  to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars ;  this hotel is one of the best in Chicago . <s> Our room was very clean and fresh ;  the public areas comfortable and the staff at the concierge and front desk very extremely helpful . <s> This is the only place to stay to be in the cnetre of the action in Chicago . <s> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! <s> ï»¿Hilton Chicago- When we arrived at the Hilton Chicago we expected a reasonably nice chain hotel for our stay in Chicago . <s> The price online seemed pretty reasonable and the location seemed to be pretty good . <s> Oh were we wrong . <s> We were nickled and dimed at every turn . <s> Parking is ridiculous even for a city at  $ 45 a day for self parking . <s> They advertise free wifi  but read the fine print and realize that is only in the lobby or shell out a hundred extra for business class rooms . <s> I felt like I was still in the airport being charged for every little thing . <s> The hotel itself is the hotel equivalent of a McMansion :  it tries hard to look like something high class but a second glance shows a somewhat pedestrian lobby space that has high vaulted ceilings and faux paintings to pretend to be a true luxury hotel . <s> The room itself was reasonably sized ;  for a lower end hotel . <s> When I am paying up for a Hilton I expect more than the bare bones . <s> Our room had a view of an alley . <s> When we asked to be switched to a lake view room we were told the upgrade would be an additional fee . <s> They also say they are centrally located but central to what ? <s> The hotel is near Grant Park but any other part of the city is an L ride away at least . <s> While the L is fantastic ;  a city like Chicago is best observed by walking ;  though it would be best if you avoid breaking a sweat or you will need to rinse off in the phone booth sized shower . <s> Overall the Hilton provides a hardly passable experience where you will walk away feeling like your pocket was picked for a weak product . <s> I would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are . <s> For my wife and I ;  we enjoy the warmer colors . <s> Cleanliness along with excellent staff ;  made me feel away from home yet relaxed . <s> Being right Downtown was perfect for location . <s> The suites are very quiet as well . <s> I surprised my wife with the  " Shopping Package "  . <s> What a hit ! <s> Thanks Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown  !  ! <s> My stay at the Sofitel was great . <s> I loved the location it was in . <s> From the moment I arrived the experince was great ;  the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too . <s> I thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable . <s> The room service was excllent and they were very friendly . <s> Checkout was a breeze and I couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay . <s> The Hilton Hotel helped us make the most of our trip to Chicago . <s> Not only are they centrally located near most of Chi towns hot spots ;  but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions . <s> The Hilton is very classy with their accommodations . <s> I will be returning at my earliest convenience ;  be it for business or pleasure . <s> Fairmont - I was not impressed with this hotel . <s> I have stayed at other hotels in the Chicago area in the past and Fairmont Chicago pales in comparison to those . <s> Upon checking in ;  I noticed that the room had not been cleaned and only the bed was made . <s> Also ;  the tables had cigarette burns on it . <s> Upon inspecting the bathroom ;  I found out that the bathroom doors did not close properly . <s> When I tried to get some work done ;  I had trouble with the spotty wi-fi because I kept getting disconnecting after every few minutes . <s> While the bed was comfortable ;  I could not get much sleep due to the street-level noise of vehicles and people . <s> I would not recommend this hotel at all and will definitely stay at another hotel the next time I'm in Chicago . <s> My wife and I live in the Western Suburbs of Chicago . <s> For our anniversary ;  we booked a night at the Fairmont based on recommendations from friends . <s> While the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city ;  the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations . <s> For starters ;  we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive . <s> However ;  the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us . <s> While the room was certainly adequate ;  the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included . <s> While the latter may seem like a minor offense ;  it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality . <s> Finally ;  the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for Chicago's standards . <s> In summary ;  the Fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price ;  I am sure we could of done better . <s> James Chicago-I did not like my stay at the James . <s> It was a bit too noisy on the lower floors  ( we were fourth ;  facing away from the lake )  ;  and the water pressure was not very good on the showers . <s> The management did try to alleviate the situation with the showerhead ;  but they got to our request on the third day of our stay . <s> The only plus was that the location was pretty good ;  we were by the Lake and a couple blocks northeast of the El . <s> However ;  for the price ;  it was not worth it . <s> Allegro Chicago - When planning my last visit to Chicago ;  I looked at many hotels but quickly focused on the Allegro mainly because I felt that a 4 star hotel for under  $ 200 a night was a very good deal . <s> And ;  after having spent a couple of nights there ;  I can assure you it is . <s> It was a leisure trip ;  half to spend time with friends and half to see how the city had changed in the last 2 years since I visited it and so I wanted to try to get a separate living suite so my friends  ( who don't live in the downtown area )  could spend more time with me . <s> Choosing the King Suite at the Allegro made this trip a lot easier and more fun . <s> The separate living suite allowed me to spend more time with my friends after we had hit the bars and clubs ;  and they could actually spend the night in my room comfortably . <s> This wasn't possible in pretty much all the other hotels I've stayed at . <s> Apart from that ;  the hotel is of pretty standard quality as far as 4 star hotels go ;  and I couldn't tell you much about the location since I like to walk about cities . <s> However ;  the separate living area in a 4 star hotel all for under  $ 350 was a great deal ;  rooms like that usually go for hundreds more . <s> I stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago . <s> That was the last time I will be staying there . <s> When I arrived ;  I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking . <s> They wanted at least  $ 10 . <s> What am I paying for when I stay there for the night ? <s> The website also touted the clean linens . <s> The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean . <s> The problem was with all of the down pillows etc . <s> Don't they know that people have allergies ? <s> I also later found out that this hotel allows pets . <s> I think that this was another part of my symptoms . <s> If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay . <s> I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking . <s> Beware hidden costs . <s> I will try somewhere else in the future . <s> Not worth the money or the sneezing all night . <s> I want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time :  The deal says  " free breakfast "  included in the price . <s> However ;  what they don't tell you ;  is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit  ( or two )  ! <s> Moreover ;  you need to ask for these  " tickets "  at the lobby when you check in - they won't give them to you automatically ! <s> We stayed there over Christmas '03 ;  and we ;  and I noticed several guests who bought the same package ;  had a rather unpleasant experience ! <s> The hotel is nice though ;  if you don't consider their lousy service ! <s> I would not recommend this hotel . <s> Although it is in a good area ;  the room was very small and is getting rather dated . <s> The room had extensive damage . <s> The paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling . <s> The wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling . <s> The wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on . <s> There was mold and stains on the bathroom tile . <s> The room was very small . <s> There was not room for a sofa . <s> Just a small faded chair and ottoman . <s> The carpet had stains on it . <s> Also ;  the bed was comfortable ;  but there was not a top sheet ;  just the bottom sheet and a comforter . <s> Overall I was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged . <s> I have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space ;  cleanliness ;  and value for the money paid . <s> My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower for three nights last month . <s> We were celebrating our anniversary ;  so we decided to splurge on the Prestige Suite . <s> According to the website ;  we were to be given either a city or park view ;  neither of which we had . <s> Instead ;  our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees . <s> The woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient ;  and the man who helped with our bags was the same . <s> When we got to the room ;  the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming . <s> The bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink . <s> My husband requested that we be given another room ;  preferably a clean one ;  but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available . <s> If given the chance ;  I would not stay at this hotel again ;  even if I were offered a free night . <s> We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end . <s> Bad cheap furniture ;  carpet that stops short of reaching the wall ;  a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew . <s> BAD BAD experience . <s> Find aother hotel plenty in the area . <s> I was completely blown away by this hotel . <s> It was magnificent . <s> I got a great deal and I am so happy that I stayed here . <s> Before arriving I was nervous as I had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay ;  for example very noisy . <s> However ;  whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant ;  it made no difference to me . <s> My room was huge ;  bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure ;  bed was perfect and the view was amazing . <s> Hotel is so close to the great shops of Magnificent Mile ;  plus a comfortable walking distance to Hancock tower and Millennium Park . <s> I stayed at the hotel during the Dave Matthews Caravan tour and would come home each night rather dusty / dirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200 ; 000 of my closest friends . <s> I used half a bottle of shampoo the first night . <s> The second night ;  the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo . <s> I informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately . <s> I got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap  ( hand soap )  for the bath / shower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place ;  nicely displayed ;  but with the EXACT SAME bottle of shampoo that was now 1 / 8 full . <s> Yeah !  ! <s> The hotel is in a great location to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave .... I'll grant them that .... but that's where their  " pros "  end . <s> I'd rather stay at a Hampton Inn . <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . <s> I really loved my stay at the Talbott . <s> My room was amazing ! <s> The bathroom  ( and I am VERY picky about hotel bathrooms )  had ample room for all of my stuff ;  which is a bonus for me . <s> The staff treated me really well and they were very friendly . <s> I was afraid that I'd get a little lost ;  since it was my first trip to Chicago ;  but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area  ( Rush St .  / Michigan Ave .  --  which are *very* close by )  . <s> The hotel reminded me of those I'd stayed at in Europe . <s> The room service is 24 hours ;  which for me ;  was a bonus because I am up mostly during the nights . <s> This is the *only* place I will ever stay if I visit Chicago again . <s> For a single woman traveling alone to a strange city ;  this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable . <s> a great hotel ;  we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great ;  that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel . <s> So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9 $  and we used the buses alot  ( freezing cold )  . <s> The hotel itself is great ;  very clean rooms ;  realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had . <s> Staff very friendly ;  they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes ....  and she was right i got them in one place she told me ...  thats service ... I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area ;  did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price .... but realy a nice view makes running easyer ....  <s> What a gorgeous hotel ! <s> From the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the Sheraton and in Chicago . <s> The heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better ;  and to top it off with great restaurants ;  you couldn't ask a hotel for more ! <s> Starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we'll be back every time we visit Chicago . <s> We arrived at 10 : 30 am on a Friday ;  and they had a room ready for us by 11 : 30 am ;  mind you check in is not until 3 : 00pm . <s> We got our room on Priceline for  $ 65 . 00 per night and stayed 3 nights . <s> We were upgraded - for free - to a suite . <s> I think I was so blown away by that ;  that I forgot to thank them at check-in ! <s> Our room was fantastic . <s> It also had a wet bar and a fridge . <s> The bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers . <s> I knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini-bar . <s> The bed and pillows were very comfortable . <s> The room was very clean . <s> Every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful . <s> We stayed on the 25th floor of the east tower and had a quiet room . <s> Yes ;  you could hear people in the hallways ;  but only because they were rude and were yelling . <s> These were not children ;  they were adults . <s> I don't know why everyone complains about  $ 48 for parking . <s> This is Chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much ;  some without in / out privledges . <s> We didn't use any of the restaurants or the health club . <s> We tried to eat at the Corner Bakery but it was too crowded . <s> Breakfast at nearby Houlihan's had a buffet for  $ 9 . 99 per person . <s> Also the grocery store behind the hotel is great . <s> There is a 7-11 not too far away . <s> I don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel . <s> Yes ;  it's a big hotel . <s> If you don't want a busy lobby ;  don't stay in a 2 ; 000 plus room hotel !  ! <s> I loved the Hotel and would recommend it to anyone . <s> Not one problem . <s> Wasn't too busy for me . <s> Would stay here again in a heartbeat . <s> I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! <s> I was very pleasantly surprised ;  as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway ;  and he usually picks bad places-haha . <s> Anyway ;  the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated . <s> It was busy and the line was a little long ;  but it moved quickly . <s> The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good ;  especially since it seemed to be near full . <s> The room was clean and spacious  ( especially considering it's a city hotel )  . <s> We made a lot of use of the concierge ;  since again ;  it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans . <s> He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! <s> It was also great being near the theater district ;  and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare . <s> I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! <s> very trendy . <s> My husband is not as easily impressed ;  but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon . <s> Overall ;  really nice stay in a four star ;  or probably four and half star hotel ! <s> This hotel was great - In a great area right downtown and close to everything . <s> The daily happy hour had great food ;  wine and premium liquors . <s> The free breakfast was even better ! <s> Actually I believe everything was included breakfast / happy hour / business center / WiFi . <s> Our room was a king size facing the back of the building . <s> Really clean new and comfortable . <s> Small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - Would highly recommend . <s> After reading the reviews on this hotel ;  I decided to book my stay for July 4th weekend here and I am glad I did ;  this hotel is absolutely beautiful . <s> Our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows . <s> I do have 1 complaint . <s> The bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great ;  but other than that I loved it . <s> I would definitely stay there again . <s> This hotel was incredible ! <s> Haven't had a better stay in a hotel in my life . <s> I will definitely come here again next time I am in Chicago ! <s> The rooms were so elegant ;  with their modern color schemes . <s> The staff members were friendly and willing to lend a hand . <s> The beds were surprisingly comfortable ;  with interesting covers . <s> The TVs were HD ;  which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before . <s> There was a cool martini bar that I spent an hour at one night ;  which was enjoyable ;  especially because of the live jazz band <s> My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great . <s> The check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question ;  and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while . <s> The rooms were well decorated and spacious ;  although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door . <s> The bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late . <s> I would definitely stay here again ! <s> If you are looking for a hotel that is truly in the best location ;  the Intercontinental is it -- right on the Magnificent Mile ;  next to the Chicago River ;  across from the Wrigley Building . <s> My daughter and I stayed here for a getaway ;  and quickly were able to get to Milennium Park ;  shopping ;  Navy Pier ;  great dining ;  exploring festivals and strolling through beautiful areas along the lakefront and Chicago River . <s> Check-in was easy and we were treated with courtesy throughout our stay . <s> Maria ;  one of the concierges ;  was especially helpful in finding us a unique place to eat . <s> The room was lovely and comfortable ;  although our tub didn't drain well . <s> Just a wonderful stay ! <s> I've used Priceline for every trip I've made back to Chicago and I've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown . <s> This was my first and last stay at the Ambassador East . <s> Its conveniently located near the Clark / Division stop on the El's red line . <s> That is the best part of our experience . <s> When we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens . <s> I've never had that issue at any other hotel I've stayed at . <s> The room's decor was outdated and the TV was tiny . <s> The hotel charges for usage of Internet . <s> You could hear people in the hallway and when you're in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms . <s> We weren't in Chicago to stay in the hotel however ;  for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isn't the place . <s>  ... read more <s> I stayed at the Palmer House for @  $ 150 / night on a corporate rate . <s> The bed was excellent ;  the linens / towels were top of the line . <s> I did not find my room shabby ;  as other reviewers noted . <s> The Palmer House is over 130 years old . <s> Rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture ;  I think that lends to the ambience of the place . <s> It is expensive ;  and I'm not sure I'd stay there if my company weren't picking up the tab . <s> But the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring . <s> We booked our room on Priceline ;  and got a good deal at around  $ 100 per night . <s> We stayed for the first 2 nights of our US trip so didnt use too many of the hotel's facilities The hotel is centrally located ;  just over the Chicago River from the shops at North Michigan Avenue ;  and around a mile from Navy Pier Our room was clean and comfortable ;  and on the 29th floor we had a good view of the city ;  and could just about see Lake Michigan  ( though the weather was very bad )  . <s> The layout of the room is a little peculiar ;  with the bed facing away from the window ;  but over all we have no complaints about this hotel ;  and unlike some other reviews we were not disturbed at all by noise from other guests So ;  pros and cons :  Pros :  Helpful and friendly staff Clean and comfortable throughout Spacious rooms Large and airy public areas Starbucks and gift shop in lobby Cons A large hotel ;  so a long walk from the elevators to the front desk  /  lobby area <s> I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in mid-March and was so disappointed with everything . <s> The room was small ;  the carpets in the looby were smelly ;  no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows . <s> Not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days . <s> It costs  $ 10 / day to connect to internet . <s> If you want to use internet in the lobby ;  minimum charge is  $ 5 per use . <s> To use the phone in the rooms for local calls ;  it is  $ 1 . 25 / 15mins and then 10 cents every min . <s> Even the local calls are charged ;  what a rip off !  !  ! <s> Every hotel I have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast ;  of course no such thing at this hotel . <s> No indoor pool ;  go figure . <s> I won this from bidding process at priceline ;  I will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future . <s> the experince at the hard rock hotel in chicago was fantastic ; i will rate them a 6 out of 5 .  they have wonderful service and great staff and the view is just wonderful . <s> First off ;  don't get a room on a lower floor ;  the garbage pick up makes a ton of noise and wakes you up at 6 am . <s> Then don't bother going down for breakfast at that time either ;  because the restaurant isn't open that early . <s> When it finally opened ;  the breakfast arrived cold and late . <s> Nothing like congealed eggs to start your day . <s> The fitness center had no towels and no cups for water . <s> It was also too hot and too many people had sweated too much in it . <s> After my congealed breakfast ;  it really was not pleasant . <s> My entire three day visit was like that . <s> I tried room service that night ;  but again ;  service was very slow and the food not warm when it arrived . <s> My high speed internet was not so high speed when it would connect me at all . <s> The furniture was run down and worn . <s> Pool towels were not always available . <s> Generally ;  for the price I paid ;  I would expect better service and a better maintained premises . <s> Chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers . <s> When visiting the Windy City ;  however ;  the Conrad Hotel and Resort is one to avoid . <s> While the description promises clean accommodations ;  luxury amenities ;  and  " deep soaking tubs ;  "  in relity ;  the rooms fall short of expectations . <s> I opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet . <s> A bit disappointed ;  I decided to ignore this fact . <s> Hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels ;  I made my way to the bathroom . <s> While I did find a large ;  deep bathtub ;  there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look . <s> Hardly what I expected for the price I paid for the accommodations . <s> In the corner of the bathroom ;  I found a reminder of a pevious guest ;  a clump of blond hair . <s> The maid service seemed to be lacking . <s> Not to be deterred from enjoying my stay ;  I decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen I had been promised . <s> Unfortunately ;  the battery to the remote control was dead . <s> I called the front desk ;  at my wits' end ;  to complain about the issues ;  but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word . <s> Overall ;  I would definitely not recommend the Conrad Hotel and Resort in Chicago . <s> My room was dirty ;  the staff was unfriendly ;  and the ammenities were few and far between . <s> On my next stay in Chicago ;  I will definitely stay elsewhere . <s> this is my letter to the management .....  Sir or Madam :  I am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the Amalfi . <s> We were a guest from 11 / 20 to 11 / 23 . <s> During our stay we used the  " Valet "  Service operated through Standard Parking . <s> Our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments . <s> Much to my chagrin ;   $ 44 / day valet service did not include proper security / monitoring ;  despite the premium over  " self park "  . <s> I understand that these parking services are sub-contracted by the hotel ;  but I would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation . <s> This was not the case . <s> I hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests <s> Conrad Chicago ;  " This hotel has a mediocre service . <s> We ordered for room service and it arrived very late and there wasnâ€™t an apology also . <s> The room had no coffee maker and we had to make a trip to the restaurant to have coffee or tea . <s> The Internet service was free but it didnâ€™t make any difference as it was so slow that I used my personal internet dongle to browse the web . <s> I would not recommend this hotel to anyone . <s>  "  <s> My husband and I recently stayed at the Conrad Chicago for three nights ;  a Thursday through Saturday . <s> Let me say we were less than pleased with our experience . <s> We chose to stay in the  " King Bed Deluxe Room "  and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations . <s> Upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly ;  the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser . <s> The room was size was average ;  and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room . <s> The major annoyance was how loud people were . <s> We came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running . <s> That is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel . <s> You can expect a loud guest maybe once ;  but every night is ridiculous . <s> The service was also extremely sub par . <s> We had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work . <s> One day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me . <s> She completely disregarded the sign ;  did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in . <s> It scared me and I'm just glad I was not getting out of the shower or changing . <s> So to sum up ;  we will never stay at the Conrad again ;  we will never recommend it to anyone else ;  and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in Chicago . <s> Wow . <s> Here is a place to NEVER hold an event . <s> First ;  no one smiles ;  including the bartenders . <s> Doesn't anyone here know they are in the HOSPITALITY business ? <s> The bartender was 54 years old . <s> Why do I know that ? <s> Because ;  she stated to another employee that  " when you get to be 54 years old ;  you tell it like it is . <s>  "  Very specifically ;  she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things . <s> Wow . <s> The room was set up the wrong way for the event . <s> The food was just plain bad . <s>  $ 9 at a Ponderosa would have been as good . <s> However ;  this is the Swisshotel . <s> Oh ;  let's go back to the bartender telling us ;  unsolicited ;  about all the problems with the hotel . <s> Man ;  you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business . <s>  $ 50 for valet . <s> Ouch . <s> Anyone asking you if you need something ;  like help ? <s> No . <s> Does management make excuses ? <s> You bet . <s> Do you ever want to hold an event here ? <s> Big no . <s> I would like to add a comment ;  maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination . <s> My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower ;  we were amazed . <s> She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding ;  and Sofitel made this happen for her . <s> They took care of all the invitations ;  cake decor ;  and so much more . <s> The special day for my daughter was worth everything . <s> If you are going to be in the Chicago area ;  check them out ;  you will not regret it ! <s> I had an awful experience here . <s> The staff were rude and unhelpful . <s> It took forever to check in and when I did ;  they took a while to even find my reservation . <s> When I got to the room ;  it was marginally clean and when I complained ;  they said they were full and could not do anything for me . <s> I would never go back . <s> They are obviously not worried about customer service . <s> This hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here . <s> The Amalfi Hotel Chicago advertises itself as a  " luxury hotel "  located in downtown Chicago . <s> Since it is in downtown Chicago ;  that means that I had street noises keeping me up most of the night . <s> My view also suffered . <s> They had nicer rooms available with better views ;  but the markups to stay in them was outrageous ! <s> The room itself was decent ;  with clean linens and nice air conditioning ;  but I can get that in just about any hotel these days . <s> There wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me ;  but for the price I paid for the room ;  I certainly had that expectation . <s> It was a let down . <s> Affinia Chicago is one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed at . <s> Not in my life have I been treated so poorly as a guest . <s> The front desk was very unaccommodating when I asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation . <s> There was no bellhop available for some strange reason so I had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself . <s> If it wasn't already a bad stay ;  I ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered . <s> If they didn't have air conditioning in the room ;  I would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable . <s> If you are traveling to Chicago for any kind of business ;  I hope you decide not to choose this hotel . <s> I was quite surprised ;  I like Chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience . <s> Palmer House A Hilton Hotel – I was hesitant at first to book a room at the Palmer House ;  but I decided to give it a try . <s> Though it was a high class hotel ;  I did not find my stay to be worth the price I paid . <s> My room was not much better than any other average hotel I have stayed at before . <s> It was a pretty small room especially given the high cost . <s> The food served at the Lockwood Restaurant was nothing special . <s> Also ;  I thought it was outrageous that I had to make a reservation in order to go to the bar ;  especially since I am a paying guest at the hotel . <s> In the end ;  I thought the Palmer House is a nice hotel but definitely not worth the amount of money I paid for my stay . <s> I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife . <s> I was on business but I thought I'd take her so we could see the city as well . <s> Chicago was great ;  The Allegro ... not so much . <s> I mean it looked nice ;  great lobby and all . <s> The service wasn't so great though . <s> The clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude . <s> Like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend . <s> The bell hop took our bags to our room ;  none to gently . <s> My wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room . <s> Which wasn't that bad till he actually asked for a tip ! <s> Our room was okay . <s> The bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved . <s> The next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasn't cleaned . <s> Our trip to the Chicago had it's nice moments ;  all outside the hotel . <s> The Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better . <s> I won't stay there again . <s> This hotel is overpriced . <s> One should pay money for luxury ;  but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge . <s> When you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because ;  yes ;  they do have to make money . <s> But the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me . <s> When I got there and went to my room ;  I thought that there would be nice colors ;  a great view ;  and deluxe bedding . <s> What I got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target -- they were not cheap ;  but not that expensive either . <s> I think I could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night I paid . <s> We stayed 2 nights at the Knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay . <s> The hotel has recently renovated there rooms . <s> The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from Dave and Cora at the martini bar to Julie at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us . <s> The hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that Chicago offers . <s> Our pick for THE CITY is the Knickerbocker . <s> JOHN and JUDY . <s> My husband and I stayed in the Hilton Chicago and had a very nice stay ! <s> The rooms were large and comfortable . <s> The view of Lake Michigan from our room was gorgeous . <s> Room service was really good and quick ; eating in the room looking at that view ;  awesome ! <s> The pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it . <s> Great location for all of the downtown Chicago attractions such as theaters and museums . <s> Very friendly staff and knowledgable ;  you cant go wrong staying here . <s> The Intercontinental Chicago was not as great an experience as I was expecting it to be . <s> When I first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system . <s> They then tried to make me book a higher paying room . <s> I ended up having to ask for the manager ;  who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate . <s> I was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite . <s> I was not doted on as I should have been and found that I had long wait times when I placed an order with room service or needed the concierge . <s> For the price I was paying to stay there I would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service . <s> Mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems . <s> First the good :  Outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland ;  as befitted the season . <s> The restaurant service was absolutely flawless  (  servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them ;  remember clients clearly from one day to the other ;  and go above and beyond consistently )  . <s> Rooms are comfortable :  yes the beds are great ! <s> The gym is well equipped . <s> Second the slightly off putting :  mmmhh ... we got the  " I love chocolate package "  which advertized :  bfast every day ;  dinner once ;  snack once and ... a gift . <s> And we have an A-Club favorite guest membership ;  which also advertized  "  a gift "  . <s> So ;  no gift ... either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership . <s> Upon enquiry ;   " the snack was the gift "  . <s> Not at all what the package suggested . <s> That said ;  bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well . <s> Some problems at checkout though :  we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem . <s> Would absolutely go back ;  but probably not on a special package . <s> Stayed here for two nights and really enjoyed the stay . <s> The cost was a little bit more than I usually care to spend ;  but turned out to be a great value . <s> Location was walking distance to restaurants and the subway . <s> Really close to the Miracle Mile and Millennium Park . <s> Room was large ;  cozy ;  and beautiful- especially loved the window seats with a great view of the river . <s> Complementary wine hour and a goldfish in the room made this a special experience ! <s> When I arrived at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I was shocked at the poor and dangerous neighborhood it was situated in . <s> This was not the Chicago I was hoping for . In addition to that ;  it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website . <s> The paint was faded and chipped ;  there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of . <s> After we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk ;  someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name . <s> After a long trip ;  I'm sure you know how aggravating that was . <s> Finally I got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation . <s> Once we got to our room ;  it was very small ;  smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood . <s> Also ;  as we were walking to the room in the hallway ;  a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place . <s> To top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night . <s> All we heard was lots of frighteningly loud love making and arguments ensuing that even a television could not mask . <s> It was a nightmare . <s> Oh yeah ;  and the shower did have any hot water . <s> We complained to the desk and they said that it was not there fault and that it would be fixed my next week . <s> When we asked for a discount they said that there were no refunds and that we could leave whenever we wanted . <s> Spent a wonderful night at the Amalfi with friends . <s> The evening reception was very nice and the staff was very attentive . <s> Breakfast was a plus ;  rooms were cozy and very clean . <s> Would not hesitate to go back again . <s> Let me just preface this by saying that I absolutely loved my stay at this hotel . <s> I chose it largely for location as I don't really love to walk that much and I was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city . <s> It was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and I mainly ventured out for food ;  of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help . <s> We had originally booked the King Guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the Deluxe King Guestroom by the front desk . <s> Everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something I look for and remember when I go to stay in a location again . <s> Our room was amazing . <s> Seriously amazing . <s> It was so chic and I just loved the headboard over our bed . <s> There wasn't one little spot of dust to be found . <s> The bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet . <s> We didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious . <s> We had dinner at David Burke's Primehouse . <s> I cannot recommend the NY Ribeye more highly . <s> It was fantastic . <s> For dessert we had the brown butter corn cake . <s> I've been trying to replicate that dish ever since I got home . <s> I'm sad to say that I didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at Spa by Asha but I definitely will make a point to on my return visit . <s> The James Chicago made our trip to Chicago memorable . <s> The staff was friendly ;  the hotel beautiful ;  and the food delicious . <s> What more could you want ? <s> I have been stayed in Allegro for two days . <s> There are not other big prolems but one thing I'm not satisfied with is the light . <s> It is dark in the room . <s> Also in the bathroom ;  the light is not good . <s> I have to open curtains . <s> I have complained about this to their reception . <s> They said they will fix it ;  but I did not get any response . <s> I am very disappointed and I will never come back again . <s> Thank god I got this hotel through priceline . <s> I can't imagine paying full price for this place . <s> The tub was moldy and dingy . <s> The toilet didn't flush . <s> Their selection of TV channels was limited to say the least . <s> Unless you wanted to pay  $ 5 for a rerun of an NBC show . <s> Oh ;  and internet ? <s> Why that will set you back about  $ 15 for the day . <s> And breakfast ? <s> That's about  $ 16 for a cup of coffee ;  a croissant and two slices of honeydew . <s> This hotel is the pits . <s> The customer service is .... absent ! <s> When you walk in to the ridiculous lobby  ( decked out like some bad late 80's prom )  there's no one to direct you upstairs to the check in . <s> And once you're there ;  check in is very fast ;  i'll grant them that . <s> This hotel is a big ;  crummy rip-off . <s> I will never stay here  ( and will steer clear of Hyatts in general I believe )  . <s> The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice ;  but it certainly does not  " exceed expectations "  as touted on their website . <s> Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler . <s>  " Chic but not fussy "  is an overstatement . <s> The room was clean ;  although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it hadn't been cleaned since the last guest . <s> There was hand lotion and shampoo samples ;  but no soap sample . <s> The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed . <s>  " Cheap "  might have been a better adjective . <s> Check out was simple and not much hassle . <s> Overall ;  the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch ;  but next time ;  I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room . <s> We live down the block from the hotel . <s> We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away . <s> The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night . <s> I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there . <s> Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there . <s> I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself . <s> The lobby is elegant . <s> The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated . <s> The location is the best residential area in the city  ( as far as I am concerned  --  I live two blocks away )  and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue  (  a good shopping street )  and reasonably convenient to the Loop  (  the main business area )  There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city . <s> I paid less than  $ 100 including tax for one night . <s> I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around . <s> My wife and I stayed two nights at the Talbott at the end of February . <s> This little hotel was the perfect place for us . <s> The lobby is very small but also cozy ;  and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold . <s> The staff was very friendly and efficient . <s> The room was pretty spacious ;  and the king bed was extremely comfortable . <s> We had a seventh floor room facing delaware st ;  so there was really no view . <s> The bathroom was a good size ;  including two sinks and a spacious tub / shower . <s> There was also free wireless internet ... a big plus for us . <s> Perhaps the best thing about the Talbott is the location . <s> We were only a few steps from State ;  Rush ;  and North Michigan . <s> Tons of shopping ;  bars ;  and good food are easily within walking distance . <s> This makes the Talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in . <s> We highly recommend the Talbott ;  and will gladly stay again on return trips . <s> Me and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features . <s> We did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco . <s> We decided to stay for 3 nights . <s> When we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights . <s> The staff was upstiff ;  and didn't not offer much hospitality . <s> Our room did have a view ;  but of the city lights and kept our room bright ;  even with the curtains closed . <s> The beds appeared soft ;  but did not offer much comfort . <s> For what we paid ;  we expected more . <s> Our third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two . <s> The staff are consistently friendly ;  polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door ;  servicing the rooms ;  managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk . <s> They genuinely seem happy to be working here and can't do enough for their guests . <s> The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other  ( we didn't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy )  . <s> The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave ;  or catching a bus or subway . <s> There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks ;  which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc . <s> My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot' for a huge variety of beer . <s> Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites ;  because we wouldn't stay anywhere else ! <s> While the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago promises upscale accommodations and a unique experience ;  they fail to deliver . <s> Unless of course ;  a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door . <s> If you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed . <s> The  " A "  list celebrities will not be there . <s> In fact ;  it would be rare to find anyone on the  " B "  list either . <s> The party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert . <s> The party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar . <s> The walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played . <s> As for the promise of Art Deco ;  it must have changed in definition . <s> Your room will truly look like a concert has just been held . <s> The carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer . <s> The bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description . <s> Quality service and amenities were severely lacking . <s> Guests are not greeted with warmth but with disdain . <s> Do not bother complaining about the noise next door either . <s> It is part of you unique experience . <s> The only part of the Hard Rock Hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in Chicago . <s> It was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip . <s> The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable ;  it has a very modern feel . <s> The rooms were very well designed ;  and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means . <s> The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable . <s> We planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the Swissotel Chicago . <s> Our fun time was not exactly that . <s> Upon arriving for our weekend getaway ;  we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite ;  did not mean a thing . <s> Apparently ;  there were none of the kids suites available . <s> The kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room :  coloring ;  video games ;  etc . <s> No one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available . <s> Whatever . <s> So ;  we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available . <s> Guess what ? <s> We spent the whole weekend in the same room . <s> Yes ;  the staff apologized ;  but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it . <s> Other than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly ;  the rooms were clean . <s> We did not spend a lot of time in the hotel ;  but I will not be booking a room here again . <s> The staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all . <s> Conrad Chicago ;  " I stayed in this hotel when I went to Chicago for vacation and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience . <s> The ambience in the bedroom was way better than the other hotels that I have visited . <s> The bathroom was spacious and had a big tub . <s> They had separate commode room as well . <s> Too bad the hotel didnâ€™t have a spa or a pool . <s> They provide free in-room internet service which is a plus . <s> The Terrace restaurant was decent but it didnâ€™t have much vegetarian options . <s> The concierge was very helpful in recommending the places to visit nearby . <s> The hotel is located at a perfect place in the middle of Magnificent Mile ;  very close to Michigan Ave which has a lot of wonderful shops . <s> All in all a very good stay and worth the money I paid . <s>  "  <s> The Affinia in Chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences . <s> If you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for Affinia ;  do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations ;  even at their high prices . <s> When we arrived our reservation was lost ;  then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available . <s> The furnishings in the room were cheaply made ;  the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's L shaped corridor . <s> I called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time . <s> Two hours later someone came . <s> The dining hall and reception areas were really nice ;  but again ;  unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at Affinia . <s> Even if you could ;  the prices wouldn't be worth it . <s> Excellent service ! <s> Clean and spacious rooms with a great view of downtown Chicago . <s> Location is excellent for exploring the main sights and the Golden Mile . <s> Great concierge service . <s> Pricey though ...  Don't valet if you don't need to . <s> My stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one . <s> I loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping . <s> I also loved the Pump Room . <s> What a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary . <s> The front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost . <s> They found me a room immediately even though the city was book up . <s> I thought the rooms were clean and well maintained . <s> The shampoo was great and I decided to take it home with me . <s> I am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago . <s> I selected The Talbott for my recent family vacation to Chicago . <s> We chose the hotel for it's close proximity to Navy Pier and otherwise central location . <s> In retrospect ;  the phrase  " location ;  location ;  location "  apparently does not apply to hotels . <s> It's a good thing the location was so great ;  because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad . <s> Upon our arrival ;  our room was not ready . <s> The clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation ;  and told us simply that  " we would have to wait "  without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready . <s> When we finally arrived in the room ;  the sheets were not clean . <s> A call to housekeeping proved difficult ;  as I do not speak Spanish . <s> The second day of our trip ;  housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our  " please service "  sign hung on the door . <s> We stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on Michigan Ave . <s> When the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order ;  it was cold and not very good . <s> Despite these poor impressions ;  the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout . <s> My call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in Mumbai . <s> They will not receive my business again . <s> Stayed here October 31 through November 5 for a cconference . <s> This is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect . <s> The Art Institute and Millenium Park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel . <s> My room was small ;  but beautiful . <s> The bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows . <s> Alas ;  no coffee maker in the room ... The staff was helpful and friendly . <s> I'd stay here again ! <s> conrad - The conrad is a terrific hotel ! <s> When I booked my room ;  I specifically asked them for a lower floor because I have fear for the heights ;  and they were really considerate in giving me a lower floor room with an excellent view . <s> The room was larger than I expected and was very clean ;  and I could not be happier with what they gave me . <s> Would come again . <s> I loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities . <s> Great location ;  as it's so close to both lakeshore and city . <s> Chicago is such a walkable city ;  so this was a superb base . <s> The staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient . <s> The room was wonderful - very ;  very comfortable and exceptionally clean . <s> Great chair . <s> Great coffee . <s> Lovely bathroom with a huge ;  absolutely fantastic shower . <s> It was also extremely quiet . <s> That ;  and the best bed ever ;  meant I slept so well and since I was there for a week ;  that was very important to me . <s> Yummy martinis at the Martini Bar . <s> I will most definitley be back ! <s> My fiance and I traveled to Chicago for the first time this December and we were not happy with this hotel . <s> The friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys . <s> They greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay . <s> The rest of the staff however was terrible . <s> When we first checked in ;  I was instantly discouraged . <s> The front desk person was not in a good mood and I couldn't wait to leave the lobby . <s> Having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing . <s> We asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations . <s> We felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff . <s> At one point ;  the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her ;  as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well . <s> Even though she saw us standing there ;  after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first . <s> Yes ;  we are in our mid 20's ;  but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible . <s> For how much money we paid for each night ;  I would have rather stayed somewhere else . <s> We decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews ;  but we did not experience any of this during our stay . <s> The rooms were alright ;  but nothing special . <s> I would not stay in this hotel again . <s> Extravagant ;  Exuberant Experience ! <s> Our stay at Hotel Allegro was very enjoyable . <s> The intoxicating views made the get-away much more relaxing ;  as well as the exceptional room service . <s> The rooms were very decorative and well above par . <s> I very much enjoyed the complimentary tea . <s> I Would highly recommend Hotel Allegro as a must stay vacation get-away . <s> First room's heating system sounded like we had a generator in our room . <s> Second room had stool in the toilet and a smear on the linens  ( which we didn't notice until morning-eeewwhh !  )  . <s> The computer ;  scale and ink pen didn't work . <s> The maintainance man took 30 mins to come unplug the toilet and dripped to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet . <s> This room was quiet and the bed / pillows comfortable . <s> The bath was large and water warm . <s>  " Classy "  ;  " Decent "  and  " Serene "  . <s> these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago . <s> the hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel . <s> the lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle . the staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite ;  helpful and responsive to my needs . <s> the room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home ;  making the talbott a home away from home . <s> my wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer . <s> believe me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids . <s> it felt very safe . <s> anytime we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home ! <s> I expected a bit more from the Hyatt Regency Chicago I stayed at recently . <s> I was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in . <s> The linens were not clean ;  the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left ;  and there was a lock on the door that didn't function . <s> The turndown service left me no chocolate on my pillow and I think they took a few more pieces of the already nearly empty toilet paper ;  again with out leaving a spare . <s> I would not stay there again . <s> Traveler beware !  ! <s> We had a king deluxe room for 2 nights . <s> We reserved the room through the hotel website with AAA discount . <s> We paid  $ 180 / nt . <s> We enjoy boutique hotels ;  as they have so much more personality and personal service . <s> This hotel was no exception . <s> Every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful . <s> The room was clean ;  well decorated ;  spacious and quiet . <s> We were offered at check-in a room with a view ;  but warned it was across from the elevator ;  so we decided to take the quiet ;  large room with no view . <s> The location of the hotel was perfect for us ;  we saw Wicked while in Chicago and had no problem walking to the theater . <s> We also walked the Magnificient Mile and found the location perfect  ( we like to walk )  . <s> We had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience . <s> We ate room service for breakfast each morning ;  and the food was good and the portions were quite large . <s> We would definitely stay here again . <s> Hyatt Regency Hotel :  Good ole Downtown ;  Chicago . <s> Hypo-allergenic rooms are usually intended for the well-being of even the worst cases of allergen sufferers . <s> Well ;  when we got to our room ;  one of the first things my wife did was sneeze four times . <s> Upon setting up the channel scanning which ;  the reception came in fuzzy all around ;  there was an interattive ethernet feature that after ;  lost in confusion of how to work it ;  provided us with our first fee ! <s> The pool was in bad shape . <s> The maids seemed to come and go with no intercommunicative qualities ..  just knock knock knock . <s> We let em' right in as they started vacuuming . <s> One of the fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling was dimmer than the others and the Gideon's Bible had crib notes . <s> What a room ! <s> Not to mention what the hotel was like ! <s> Oh geez . <s> The Palmer House Hlton Hotel has to be the nicest hotel I have stayed at in Chicago . <s> I went to Chicago on a business trip for a meeting . <s> When I arrived once I walked in ;  the lobby was beautiful ;  I couldn't hardly wait to see my room . <s> The rooms were just as nice ;  the bathroom was immaculate ! <s> We had a meeting in the Clark Meeting Room ;  even that was nice ! <s> I wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself ! <s> I was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like ;  Grant Park ;  Lake Michigan ;  Mag Mile which is a shopping heaven ;  and the Navy Pier ;  it never really like the normal stressed out meetings . <s> I love Chicago and I now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while I'm in town . <s> I stayed at the Sheraton as it was where a conference I was attending was being held . <s> On the plus side ;  the hotel is reasonably well located ;  within a few minutes walk of Michigan Avenue . <s> My room had a superb view out over the river . <s> However ;  for the price I must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment . <s> The decor was dated ;  and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty . <s> The wifi is ridiculously expensive ;  and frustratingly as a conference delegate I was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access . <s> There was no wifi in the conference rooms ;  although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails . <s> I know Chicago is expensive ;  but for that price I feel the experience should have been better . <s> Will not stay here again . <s> We were here pre-construction so didn't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing . <s> But room and service quality were so poor that we will not return . <s> Our suite was large enough ;  but it was dirty ;  dated and worn . <s> The bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly . <s> Public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days ;  disgusting . <s> We  ( politely )  requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed . <s> We had paid for the King Tut Package ;  which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit . <s> They had no record of this and didn't honor it . <s> Of course ;  the exhibit was sold out ;  so our main reason for visiting Chicago was ruined as we weren't able to see this part of the Field museum . <s> My  ( also polite )  letter to Hilton and the manager was never acknowledged . <s> Very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding Hilton in general when possible . <s> I already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now I'm going to write about the location ! <s> I like to walk . <s> This place was close to EVERYTHING !  !  !  ! <s> The 'Taste of Chicago' was on during the 4th of July . <s> Let me tell you ;  this was the best 'taste' of a city that I have ever been to . <s> It was massive and took 10 mins to walk there . <s> I took the train in from the airport  ( it was around  $ 2 . 00 but it was a solid 45 mins but for  $ 2 . 00 ;  how can you complain ? <s>  ) and it was approx a 10 walk to the hotel . <s> We pretty much walked everywhere . <s> We walked the entire magnificent mile strip . <s> We went to the Blue Navy or whatever the docks are called . <s> My favourite bar was 'Pops for Champagne . <s> ' Wow . <s> I love champagne . <s> And then of course there was the John Hancock Centre . <s> And lots of shopping ! <s> Hard Rock Hotel Chicago - Location ;  location ;  location . <s> Shopping ;  restaurants ;  and Chicago attractions didn't require driving to get to . <s> The room was well maintained and had nice furniture . <s> I really liked my comfy king sized bed and cushy pillows . <s> Friendly staff and nice amenities were also plus . <s> I would stay at this hotel again . <s> After arriving at the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower hotel I was greeted with rudeness and snubery . <s> My room reservations had been double booked ;  and instead of the suite I expected ;  I was given a much smaller guest room . <s> Instead of having a concierge I had cockroaches . <s> The dining left me wishing for fast food . <s> The bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer . <s> I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton . <s> My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested . <s> I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that . <s> The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off . <s> The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up . <s> I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener . <s> There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items . <s> Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance . <s> My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff . <s> They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up . <s> I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there . <s> If you are looking for a high end hotel on the Magnificent Mile ;  the Affinia Chicago is NOT your best option . <s> First of all ;  the  " central "  location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the Navy Pier  ( which this hotel claims to be the  " official "  hotel of )  and to the shops on the Mile . <s> Secondly ;  the hotel is small - only 215 rooms ;  most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area . <s> Thirdly ;  they have one restaurant and one lounge ;  both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel . <s> Finally the Affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel . <s> One does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the Affinia ! <s> Last week ;  I booked a 'Deluxe Suite' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago . <s> I took the 'Retreat and Relax' package deal . <s> The wait to check in was intolerably long ;  because they were letting some people check in with a dog . <s> I'm allergic to dogs ;  and I'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in . <s> They insisted on escorting me to to my room ;  every time I came in ;  like I was going to break into another guest's room or something . <s> I swear ;  anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks ;  asking me if I needed anything . <s> You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you're up to something . <s> I went to the pool ;  but it was full of screaming children . <s> When I went to bed ;  I could hear the television in the next room through my wall . <s> And what's worse ;  they wouldn't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress . <s> They threatened to throw me out on the street ;  after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars ! <s> I had to go outside --  probably where the dog went to piddle --  to do it . <s> Also ;  their on-site restaurant is too expensive ;  given that you're already paying an arm and a leg for the room . <s> The food should be free ! <s> I wouldn't stay here again ;  it was a waste of my money . <s> I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked . <s> While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in it's decor  ( less traditional and more funky interior )  it is not nearly as nice . <s> The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice . <s> The rooms are also smaller . <s> The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though ;  is the bathroom . <s> It has an old tiled floor ;  with an old sink ;  and old toilet . <s> It reminds me of something you would find in a men's locker room . <s> Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror ;  it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance . <s> Also ;  the layout of the bathroom is terrible . <s> The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet . <s> Also ;  the room is not very clean as well . <s> The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers . <s> I would recommend staying at the Monaco ;  Hard Rock ;  or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice . <s> I travel to chicago quite often ;  and have stayed at a bunch of hotels . <s> I stayed at Conrad a couple of times . <s> My impression was not too good . <s> Both times the receptionist was quite cold and I didn't feel welcome at all . <s> The room was noisy . <s> Thin walls ;  and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about . <s> One time the tv was broken too ;  and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it ... <s> Anyway ;  given that this is a 4 . 5 star hotel ;  it really didnt live up to my expectations . <s> After the 1st time at this hotel ;  I thought I might give it a second try . <s> After the 2nd time ;  I decided I am really not coming back ;  especially given that there are so many other hotels close by . <s> The other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel . <s> So I guess I am not alone in this ...  <s> Omni Chicago Hotel – Stayed here for a 2 nights while attending a business-related conference . <s> Room and bathroom were clean  /  spacious and contained all the usual amenities ;  though my room surprisingly lacked a coffee machine . <s> Free wifi was provided :  a necessity for any business traveller planning to catch up on some work . <s> The continental breakfast had a wide selection of options ;  from fresh fruit and cereal to hot scrambled eggs and bacon  --  one of the best free breakfast options I have seen in a hotel . <s> Would definitely stay here again . <s> If I didn't have to stay here ;  I wouldn't . <s> Without exception ;  I swear I am not lying ;  every day of my stay brings a new problem . <s> Over the past 3 months ;  I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time ;  problems every time . <s> From the wrong food with room service ;  to room keys that dont work ;  unrefreshed bath towels ;  forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service ;  unclean ice bucket overnight ;  forgotten room cleaning ;  inability to connect to the Internet .... I'm too tired to keep writing all the problems . <s> For the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel ;  I expect more . <s> Finally ;  their team is certainly not trained in customer service . <s> The front desk teams have attitudes ;  and Aria's hostesses think they are something else . <s> I'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon ;  but I would never go back if I had a choice . <s> The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding . <s> Palmer House a Hilton Hotel - Here's a PSA :  if you enjoy peace and quiet ;  do NOT stay at the Chicago Hilton . <s> Going in ;  I didn't know the place allowed pets ;  and I got stuck next to a family that had brought their dog . <s> Forget street noise - I couldn't hear the cars over all the barking . <s> I complained ;  but management said all their basic rooms were full so I'd have to pay for an upgrade to a suite if I wanted to move . <s> The bed was comfortable enough ;  but there were some stains on the comforter when I got there . <s> At least management didn't try to charge me to fix THAT issue . <s> The pillows were a bit over-plump as well . <s> As for location ;  there are some tourist spots nearby ;  but some of the places I wanted to see were a decent distance away . <s> The zoo and the Museum of Science are too far to walk to ;  so if you want to check those places out ;  you'll have to bring your car and pay the hotel's sky-high parking prices ;  pay for a taxi ;  or figure out Chicago's public transportation system . <s> Bit of a hassle ;  really . <s> On the plus side ;  the hotel definitely impressed in the looks department :  my room was nicely decorated and the hotel's ballrooms were gorgeous . <s> When it comes down to it ;  though ;  in the future ;  I'd just rather spend my money on a comfortable room in a convenient location ;  rather than a pretty ;   " landmark "  tourist trap . <s> This hotel was wonderful . <s> My room was clean and the staff was courteous . <s> The food provided by the restaurant was exceptional . <s> This was on of the best hotel stays ;  ive experienced . <s> I highly suggest this hotel to others . <s> Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint ;  that is about the only positive of this terible hotel . <s> The guest services were unhelpful at best ;  and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful . <s> And as for the rooms ;  small ;  cramped ;  and it seemed as if the sheets hadn't been cleaned in the last 5 years . <s> My stay here was distasteful ;  and I never intend to return ;  except to ask for my money back . <s> My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor ;  there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights ;  beat up and old dorm style . <s> It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed . <s> Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely . <s> All night there are chimes that make noise ;  that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying . <s> There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you ;  I paid for the wifi ;  and still we were unable to get on . <s> Lastly ;  my sister and I split the bill ;  I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit . <s> Room cost with city taxes etc . <s> was 313 . 69 a night . <s> I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper ! <s> So while the View was wonderful ;  it is NOT worth the money . <s> Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago - I stayed at this hotel for a couple of nights several weeks ago . <s> Overall ;  it was a very comfortable experience for me . <s> The staff at the front desk were very courteous . <s> They were able to upgrade me from a standard room to one of their junior suites ;  which was a pleasant surprise . <s> Instead of just a single room ;  there was an elegant sitting area sectioned off by a half-wall to the right of the bed ;  which helped the area feel spacious . <s> To the left of the bed was an AMAZING bathroom ;  I loved the rainshower system ! <s> Very relaxing . <s> Housekeeping did an outstanding job keeping my room clean ;  and room service was very prompt . <s> My only dislike about the place is that they charge for wireless internet access ;  but that is standard for high-end hotels like the Millennium Knickerbocker . <s> The service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient . <s> The room was more then I has expected . <s> It was spacious and laid out very well . <s> I particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower . <s> The bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable . <s> I believe it's the first time I stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room . <s> The location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go . <s> I particularly enjoyed the excellent food at theChina Grill which is attached to the Hard Rock hotel . <s> The service was very good and the staff very friendly . <s> I stayed at ICH Chicago for business in November of 2006 and loved it . <s> As a Royal Ambassador member ;  they upgraded me to a beautiful junior suite with a separate living and working area and 2 bathrooms ! <s> My upgrade was in place upon arrival and a beautiful fruit basket was waiting for me on the coffee table . <s> They even had a nice young lady escort me to my room . <s> The suite was beautifully furnished and had an Art Deco feel to it . <s> The only thing I regretted was that I only stayed one night . <s> I will definitely stay here on my next visit . <s> After a one night stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago I must say that while I loved Chicago I will never go back to this hotel . <s> The problems started in the parking lot ;  yup before I even got in . <s> There was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage ;  broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble . <s> Upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room . <s> The elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as I was trying to get the bags out . <s> The hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking . <s> When in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed ;  the heater whistled and when I called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows I was hung up on . <s> This was only the beginning of our terrible stay . <s> Guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long . <s> The maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass . <s> We could not check out soon enough ! <s> We called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip . <s> This hotel was chosen by my husband's company as the family came along for the business trip . <s> The location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor . <s> My first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean . <s> The lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance ;  but was otherwise ok .  Lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long . <s> Seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there . <s> I had read from another reviewer to join the Fairmont President's club and wi-fi in the room would be free . <s> We signed up for the club ;  but were puzzled as to why they don't just offer everyone free wi-fi . <s> Parking fees were exorbitant at  $ 58 / night ;  but thankfully the company was paying for this . <s> We were able to walk to Millennium Park and Navy Pier from our hotel . <s> The hotel is NOT kid-friendly in terms of restaurants or amenities . <s> There is no swimming pool ;  but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the Swissotel next door  ( there is an underground tunnel that connects the Fairmont there )  . <s> We loved the Swissotel's pool on the 42nd floor . <s> Fantastic views from the pool ! <s> Although the beds were comfortable ;  my daughter and I were both victims of bed bugs during our stay . <s> Unfortunately we didn't know until the next day after we returned home . <s> Apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear . <s> My daughter and I both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips . <s> The bites made you want to claw your skin off ! <s> My husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all . <s> Beware of room 3405  --  bed nearest the bathroom !  !  ! <s> I will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on ....  <s> Hard Rock Hotel - I spent two nights at the Hard Rock Hotel during the week of Thanksgiving ;  and to be honest ;  it did not meet my expectations . <s> The pictures online made the rooms look huge ;  but when I arrived ;  my room was no bigger than your average 4-star hotel room . <s> The bathroom was clean ;  but again average ;  there was no luxury shower ;  the toilet was cramped up against the end of the sink vanity ;  and the sink itself was fairly shallow . <s> The hotel is in a nice location ;  but even on a Thursday night the streets below will boast noise loud enough to keep you awake . <s> Anyway ;  it's not a bad hotel ;  but it's not as exciting as you would guess . <s> Hyatt Regency Chicago - When I first arrived at the Hyatt Regency I was concerned because of the size of my room ;  but I was happily surprised . <s> There was more than enough space . <s> The beds were comfortable ;  and the location in the center of Chicago is amazing . <s> For only  $ 150 a night ;  this was a real steal . <s> The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while . <s> At almost  $ 500 a night ;  one would expect . <s> Traveling with my wife ;  I expected to pay the cost of the room ;  already being outrageous ;  but then I was hit with another  $ 20 charge for her to stay . <s> Even with a King bed ;  they only figure in one person to their cost . <s> The beds were average and although there was much to do ;  everything cost an arm or a leg . <s> It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away . <s> All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis ;  if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night ;  I definitely would have stayed somewhere else . <s> I guess you live and you learn ;  its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations . <s> After recent week stay at the Affinia Hotels ;  I can definitely say i will be coming back . <s> They offer so many in room amenities and services ;  Just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be . <s> My most enjoyable experience at the Affinia Hotel was the amazing customization they offered ;  I would recommend Affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay  . <s> My husband ;  teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last August . <s> We were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of Chicago . <s> When I complained I asked for us to be transferred to the Sheraton which they arranged for us . <s> I have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best . <s> The room  ( although I know it was not the largest )  was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed . <s> It also had superb views of the river and the lake . <s> The entrance hall to the Sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre . <s> In fact all areas are fantastic . <s> The best thing about the hotel though was the staff ! <s> From the bellboy ;  to the receptionists ;  the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful . <s> One of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son ! <s> Above and beyond the call I would say ! <s> I cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough . <s> The breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did !  ! <s> It lasted us all day . <s> If you have the choice of where to stay I think you will enjoy the Sheraton ! <s> We did !  ! <s> When I first made reservations at The Palmer House Hilton ;  I was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website . <s> Little did I know it was going to be a total disaster . <s> First off ;  my husband and I couldn't find the place . <s> It was our first time in Chicago after all . <s> And when I would call for directions ;  they just kept putting me on hold . <s> When my husband and I finally arrived ;  the bus boy was extremely rude . <s> After man-handling our luggage ;  he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip . <s> Talk about arrogant . <s> The front desk clerk was a little too pushy . <s> My husband and I were only staying one night just to attend my sister's wedding ;  but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room . <s> The room itself was okay ;  decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you're worth . <s> They even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the  " snack bar "  and ordered a movie that I've never even heard of ! <s> Completely unprofessional . <s> I will never ;  I repeat ;  NEVER stay at this hotel ever again . <s> For a supposed 4-star hotel ;  I was not very impressed at akk . <s> The lobby was nice and modern-looking ;  but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors  ( we didn't arrive that late at night )  . <s> Additionally ;  when we walked into the hotel late one night ;  there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and ;  it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in . <s> Where was the staff to clean up ? <s> That's not a very welcoming sight . <s> The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view ;  but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue ;  andi it was also a little too far south . <s> Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night ! <s> First ;  several day s prior to my stay ;  I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday . <s> Saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge . <s> When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing ..  and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday . <s> I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night . <s> The food was limp and uninspired . <s> Further ;  I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon . <s> When I called in-room dining to request a spoon ;  I was told one would be forthcoming . <s> 15 minutes later ;  a waiter arrived with a menu . <s> When I explained I already had food and I didn't need a menu - I needed a spoon ;  he had the audacity to argue with me . <s> I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so . <s> Another 15 minutes  ( and one bowl of cold soup )  later I decided to call in-room dining back to request  ( again )  they send someone with a spoon . <s> They too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon . <s> I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I didn't request ;  but that no spoon was forthcoming . <s> Another 15 minutes later ;  a spoon finally arrived . <s> Thanks - for charging me  $ 100+ so that I could argue over cold ;  flavorless food . <s> In addition to the gross customer service ;  surly attitude ;  and sorry food ;  I found the room woefully lacking . <s> It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell . <s> Further ;  I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators ... <s> I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went . <s> Homewood Suites - Wonderful stay at the Homewood Suites Hilton ! <s> Great location ;  within walking distance to the Magnificent Mile . <s> Clean room and attentive staff . <s> Take time to visit the pool as it has a great view of the cityscape . <s> Would definitely stay here again next time I am in Chicago . <s> I had a business trip coming up in Chicago and I wanted to stay someplace really nice ;  cause I had never been there ;  so made reservations with the James two weeks in advance just to be on the safe side and when I arrived they had no record of it . <s> No big deal ;  right ? <s> They said they would take care of it and get me a room right away ...  two hours later I'm still sitting in the lobby ! <s> Finally I get to my room to try and relax . <s> Everything was nice until I decided to take a shower . <s> I went into the bathroom ...  no towels ;  wash cloths ;  nothing . <s> I called down to the front desk and asked for some ;  about an hour later someone came up with one . <s> Maybe they were just really busy ? <s> Finally I get in the shower and the handle is BROKEN !  !  ! <s> I went down to the front desk and asked for a new room and they started implying that I broke it !  !  ! <s> They said everything was fine with the room earlier that day and that I must have done something to it !  !  ! <s> Leaving that hotel was the easiest decision I made on my whole trip . <s> Two thumbs down ! <s> I had high hopes for the Ambassador East Hotel ;  I really did . <s> It seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access . <s> I arrived to the hotel on a Tuesday afternoon . <s> I was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in . <s> I could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck ;  doing nothing . <s> As I walked in ;  nobody greeted me ;  and nobody offered to take my bags . <s> The hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated ;  with a fine covering of dust . <s> I went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys ;  all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer . <s> I got to my room ;  and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking ;  there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway . <s> Having paid extra for an upgraded room ;  I was extremely disappointed by the condition inside . <s> The drinking glasses were filthy ;  the towels smelled of mold ;  and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can . <s> The television was a basic CRT that looked to be about fifteen years old ;  and there was no channel guide ;  though I suppose I didn't need one for the six channels that it had . <s> I had heard good things about the food at the Ambassador East hotel ;  but alas ;  there was no respite here . <s> The room service that I ordered took forty minutes to arrive ;  and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done . <s> Elsewhere in the hotel things were no better . <s> Everywhere I went ;  from the pool to the bar ;  the staff was hasty ;  rude ;  and completely uninterested ;  and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated . <s> I really wanted to like the Ambassador East Hotel ;  but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out . <s> I recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago . <s> Sure ;  it looks nice ;  but it's really just a smoke screen . <s> I went to the clerk to check in and she was VERY rude to me . <s> I was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that I need to go find a phone book and ask someone else . <s> She also encoded my key wrong ;  so I had to have it redone . <s> I finaly get to my room ;  only to discover it was a mess . <s> The sheets were thrown on the floor ;  the curtains were wide open and to top it all off ;  the toliet hadn't been flushed . <s> It was horrible . <s> I called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up ;  but I was told they were on break . <s> Whatever thoguh ;  I cleaned up myself . <s> The night progresses and I awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door . <s> Some guy said that I was in HIS room . <s> It baffled me ;  but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up . <s> They had given his the wrong room . <s> I couldn't take one more day of all the bull . <s> I checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to Chicago . <s> I would NOT recommend this hotel to ANYONE . <s> I only stayed at this hotel for one night ;  the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy . <s> After the first long wait I started to time how long it took from the moment I pushed the button until the elevator arrived ;  never under 10 min . <s> even late at night . <s> I went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband ...  1 margarita was  $ 14 ! <s> I wans't drinking because I'm pregnant so I had a soda water for  $ 4 ...  if I would have known I would have had tap water . <s> Overall ...  great rooms ;  OK staff  ;  horrible elevators ;  overpriced drinks . <s> After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day ;  I left the hotel ;  crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab . <s> I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same . <s> After doing so ;  I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle . <s> As the cab slowed to pick me up ;  the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction . <s> When the cab stopped ;  I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman . <s> After locking the door ;  the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab . <s> After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs ;  he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a  " jerk "  before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination . <s> Consequently ;  unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen ;  please don't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman . <s> Lastly ;  as for the rest of my stay ;  you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English . <s> While I have nothing against the French or French language ;  I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world . <s> Viva la USA ! <s> Great hotel in a wonderful location . <s> I stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and I loved it . <s> I couldn't recommend it highly enough . <s> Evidently popular and busy ;  the staff were still helpful . <s> The rooms were lovely and spacious and clean . <s> Bathrooms were clean ;  bright and spacious also . <s> I'd definitely recommend this hotel too ;  it's close to the magnificant mile . <s> My wife and I had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the Drake Hotel . <s> I have stayed at the Drake before and while it is nice ;  it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price . <s> We opted to walk across the street and stay at the Millenium instead . <s> I know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and I have to say they have done a great job . <s> This place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to Chicago on a college roadtrip  ( I did )  . <s> But that is not the case any more . <s> This property is directly across from the Drake Hotel and for 1 / 2 the price you get their great location with a newer  ( albeit smaller )  room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel . <s> The rooms are tastefully decorated  ( Asian influence w / flat screen tv )  and the bed is very comfortable . <s> The bath is small  ( no tub )  ;  but very clean and the shower is great . <s> You are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting Chicago ;  so the room's size is not a big deal . <s>  ( It works well with a couple ;  but a family of four may be a bit cramped . <s>  )  The service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat . <s> I would definitely stay here again ;  but the next time I would leave the car at home  (  $ 49 / night parking is a bit steep )  . <s> My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience ! <s> The staff were helpful and considerate ;  always there to tend to my needs . <s> My suite was extremely clean ;  and had all the amenities that I could ask for . <s> I almost didn't want to leave my room ;  because it was so nice . <s> But in the end I did ;  because the hotel is situated in such a great area ;  that I had to go out and see some of the sites . <s> This hotel has wonderful rooms and service ;  and is in a really great area . <s> I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago . <s> Fantastic stay ! <s> The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean . <s> I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference . <s> Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm . <s> Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door . <s> They are the best I've ever had . <s> EVER ! <s> If youre in the mood to unwind ;  you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around . <s> I had a great time here . <s> From now on ;  I won't stay anyplace else . <s> The bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed ;  so we called maintenance to have it fixed . <s> We returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease . <s> There were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools . <s> We love Chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again . <s> The pictures on this website sure are deceiving ! <s> In real life the Palmer House Hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be ! <s> The cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning ! <s> Now ;  granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but I thought that was the only weird thing I would have to put up with on that trip . <s> It wasn't ! <s> They charged us for a mini-bar fee when we don't even drink ;  no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway ! <s> They also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time ;  so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip . <s> We had to spend  $ 50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we'd planned ! <s> And then it wasn't as good because the tour guide wasn't there and we got lost ! <s> My husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one . <s> It was terrible ! <s> I certainly won't be staying here again ! <s> I stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel for a fun weekend in Chicago . <s> The standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable . <s> I love a hotel with all white sheets because then I know it's clean . <s> I really liked the simple and modern decor ;  especially the huge upholstered headboard . <s> Nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter . <s> The bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home . <s> The staff was friendly . <s> Can't really judge the service because I didn't have any problems or complaints . <s> So I didn't have a reason to interact with the staff much . <s> Overall ;  it was a very nice hotel in a great location . <s> Will definitely stay here again on my next visit . <s> My husband attended a conference in Chicago for the weekend of June 22nd and I decided to tag along for the shopping ! <s> We flew into O'Hare and took a cab to the hotel ;  cost about  $ 30 . <s> Everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful . <s> We had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction ;  but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us . <s> We were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper . <s> The room was clean and spacious enough for us . <s> The bed is very comfy . <s> We ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great . <s> The location of this hotel is perfect . <s> You are about 1 & 1 / 2 blocks from Michigan Ave and the Hancock tower . <s> Can't beat that ! <s> There is also an adorable pet store called Tails In The City across from the hotel ! <s> I brought our dog back a couple of toys ! <s> They are very nice as well . <s> All in all ;  no complaints . <s> The hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting . <s> The staff is always friendly and the location is superb . <s> It's a safe neighborhood-I walked around by myself and felt fine . <s> We would definitely return . <s> My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . <s> When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . <s> I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool ;  one white phone and one emergency red phone ;  to call the desk . <s> Both were out of service !  !  !  ! <s> I am glad there wasn't an emergency . <s> As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ....  never heard back . <s> One more thing ;  in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table . <s> Within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding . <s> They need to update this piece of furniture . <s> I stayed here with my family when we were in Chicago on a family vacation . <s> All I can say is WOW ! <s> A fantastic experience all around . <s> First off ;  the hotel is magnificent ;  the lobby / entreway is jaw dropping to say the least . <s> Everyone we dealt with from the desk clerks ;  to the cleaning staff ;  to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly . <s> The rooms themselves are fantastic ;  perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation . <s> The new Serenity beds that the Hilton offered were to die for ! <s> One of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years ! <s> The kids loved the Ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and I loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours . <s> As usual ;  it had wifi ;  which was ultra cheap and very very fast . <s> Over all i highly recommend The Palmer House Hilton ! <s> The Amalfi Hotel in Chicago is a wonderful hotel . <s> I had the opportunity to stay there on business and wished I could have stayed for longer . <s> The staff is so nice and helpful . <s> They really treat you like a VIP and are there to help with any questions you might have . <s> The rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home . <s> In my room I had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection . <s> Did I say IN the room ? <s> I didn't even have to leave or order something on the television . <s> It was nice to shower with their AVEDA products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me . <s> While staying in for the night I was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel . The bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean ! <s> In the morning I was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage . <s> Yes ... ordered . <s> They came to my room and I didn't even have to leave . <s> Very comfy ! <s> This hotel was by far the best that I have stayed in and I travel a lot for business so I would know . You always have high expectations when you're staying at hotels and I'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded . <s> I'm recommending this hotel to everyone I know that will be staying in the Chicago area . <s> I will definitely be back and make reservations for a longer stay this time because I just didn't want to leave ! <s> I would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars . <s> Don't stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation . <s> About 3 months ago ;  we booked a room here for our wedding night  ( which is in less than 2 weeks )  . <s> My fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel - no upgrades ;  no discounts . <s> Apparently it is my problem that their manager can't manage the convention schedule . <s> I don't even want to stay at another Kimpton Hotel because I don't find their reservation system reliable . <s> Unfortunately ;  due to the conference ;  there isn't any other place to stay . <s> Upon entering my hotel room at The Palmer House Hilton I immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom . <s> After placing my bags on a poorly made bed I walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet . <s> I immediately called room service and asked for a new room . <s> They apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess . <s> After oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door . <s> She seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if I should have been the one dealing with it . <s> After the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip . <s> I hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room . <s> I thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod . <s> Yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor . <s> And nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air . <s> When I was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own . <s> If I wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa . <s> After giving up on a nice television program I decided to retire to bed . <s> Egyptian sheets ? <s> Right ! <s> All I can say is I found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour . <s> If you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel . <s> Swissotel Chicago :  Don't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you . <s> This hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect . <s> Firstly ;  the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality . <s> For example ;  the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it's support after trying to open them for a city view . <s> The bedroom bed  ( King-sized )  makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make . <s> Of coarse ;  this isn't too bad once you fall asleep ;  until then ;  it sucks ! <s> In regards to room services ;  the hotel workers are not all that friendly . <s> They talk to you in a stubborn way ;  as if they just want to get it done and over with ;  just to get their pay-check . <s> Yes they do all basic room service orders ;  but it is not all too friendly . <s> Overall ;  this hotel has it's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has  ( which is a bare minimum )  . <s> With that being said ;  I would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown Chicago area in need for at least average hotel services . <s> However ;  if sub-par service and quality is okay for you ;  then this hotel could be suitable ;  however ;  considering it's prices ;  you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms .  <s> <s>
