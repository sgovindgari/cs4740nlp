neu	I bought this unit hoping to archive my old personal VHS tapes.
neu	I had a lot of problems with it accepting my DVD disks which play with no problems on my computer's DVD player which I'm sure is a cheaper player by far.
neu	After repeatedly trying to get the unit to accept my pre-recorded DVD's it finally accepted them.
neu	I noticed that the unit couldn't recognize the markers from my computer's DVD bookmarks and the AB repeat works horribly.
neu	It works, but it freezes the picture for about 3-4 seconds before starting over which, again, my computer's DVD player does seamlessly.
neu	I expected the unit to far surpass my computer's DVD player and it doesn't.
neu	I am returning the unit to the store and looking for a better replacement.

neu	Not often does a story touch me in a way that makes me fell conflicted in the way I feel about it.
neu	I wanted to love this book so much more than I did because the story told was a fascinating one, where real world facts blend into fiction.
neu	However, I found it very hard to enjoy the book because I really disliked the main character Amir. He was to cowardly, so childish throughout his whole life, whining and complaining through much of the 371 pages it took to tell the story.
neu	While the villian of the book was truly a villian, at least he understood who he was.
neu	Amir never figures out who he is until much later in his life.
neu	I never felt bad once for Amir, but I loathed him even to the end.
neu	And that's why I could not enjoy this novel more.
neu	I couldn't connect with the character the author wanted his readers to connect with.
neu	I do not fault his writing style because it was quite an easy read and very accessible.
neu	Perhaps that's where the crux of the problem actually is.
neu	By having too simple a writing style, the author took some of the weight off a story that needed something heavier.
neu	Overall, this is a book that can be read while riding the train to and from work in a matter of a day or two.
neu	However, I do not recommend this, because the softy in me found myself tearing up on a few occasions and trying to fight back the tears as other people trying to get to work pretended not to notice.

neu	I bought this product to use mainly as a way to carry movies around on vacation for my children.
neu	It works great for that and much more.
neu	I don't know if the kids are going to get to use it.
neu	I am very impressed with the quality of the playback.
neu	It could be a little more user friendly, but I managed to figure it out easily enough.
neu	Also, you get more than enough playing time on the battery.
neu	I have watched two full length movies without rechargeing the battery.
neu	It has nice sound as an mp-3 player as well.

neu	Michael Behe has stated (in interviews) that he does not agree with a 'materialist' explanation of nature.
neu	Materialism means that we take the view that only forces and matter are what determine physical phenomena.
neu	Behe takes the view that something else is involved - something best described as Supernatural.
neu	Yet there has been no repeatable experiment (eg prayer freezes water) to demonstrate a non-materialist position.
neu	But get this...
neu	Behe has said that if scientists were to discover some non-materialist phenomena, they would keep that discovery a secret!
neu	First of all, it is open to anybody, not just scientists, to show that materialism it not a complete explanation.
neu	And to hint that scientists are keeping (or would keep) supernatural explanations secret completely misreads what science is all about.
neu	Science is about empiricism.
neu	It's just that so far, nothing at a basic, repeatable level, has demonstrated anything other than matter and forces are at work.
neu	Arguments for design always start at the top (complex systems), which misses the point completely.
neu	Any sensible understanding should begin at the bottom (simple repeated experiments), and Behe does not demonstrate that a non-materialist explanation is necessary.
neu	Until he, or anyone else, can do so, it is a waste of time to argue about intelligent design.

neu	Why did I buy this one?
neu	I keep asking myself that.
neu	Kathy Smith is a good exercise instructor-she is knowledgeable and motivational in that aspect-but she needs to stick with that-and stop doing the dance videos.
neu	I tried her Latin dance video a few years ago and it was awful...and now this.
neu	I have been bellydancing and performing with it for a few years,and I knew better-but I had to buy it.
neu	Save your money and don't.
neu	First of all-you can't teach a belly dance video if you can't belly dance yourself.
neu	The first thing I noticed was that Kathy can't keep a rhythm and you cannot properly execute most of the moves-so it was a bad idea to have her lead this video.
neu	The sets and costumes were gorgeous-but the background dancers should have been leading this one.
neu	I think since Ansuya (Of Bellydance Superstars) was in the background, and was the one who taught Kathy the dance moves-that Ansuya should have been the main instructor here, maybe with Kathy Smith "assisting her", rather than Kathy leading the video.
neu	Just to throw out a few examples of this-when Kathy was leading clockwise chest circles in the slow segment (lifting the chest up, to one side, down, then to the other side) she was letting her chest collapse to center between each move rather than holding it there.
neu	So, she was teaching a "chest circle" but she was not doing one.
neu	She was actually doing a "chest lift, chest slide, chest drop, chest slide" because she was collapsing her chest to center and not executing the movement properly.
neu	She also had trouble with basic belly dance moves such as the hip drop pattern where you drop forward, back, back, back...she was too inflexible in the hips so you ended up with forward, back, same, same.
neu	I understand that she is a beginner, and that she is not a belly dancer.
neu	This is my point.
neu	Kathy doesn't need to be a "pro" to teach these basic moves-but these are basic moves that in my area are taught in the first 10 weeks of beginning class.
neu	Kathy should have at least taken belly dance lessons for a few months from Ansuya before putting out this video-or at least long enough to master the moves she was teaching in this video.
neu	Her snake arms were stiff and lifeless and she let her arm form collapse on the downward motion of the arms every time.
neu	Belly dance is harder than it looks-and sometimes it takes a while to fully grasp these moves and to do them well-you can't take lessons for one month, and then put out a video.
neu	This was not even the worst part of the video, in my opinion.
neu	You cannot belly dance in your "perky step aerobics instructor" persona.
neu	I have NEVER seen a belly dancer perform and all of sudden squeal out "OOOOOooooowwww!"
neu	This is something that has annoyed me in Kathy Smiths fitness videos for years, but at least it is okay for an exercise instructor to be obnoxiously perky.
neu	(although I avoid exercise videos by instructors like this) This is ESPECIALLY out of place in belly dance, however.
neu	You wouldn't see a ballerina or a tap dancer shout out like that in the middle of a number, and I feel that Middle Eastern dance deserves the same respect.
neu	I found Kathy's overall attitude about belly dance appalling.
neu	Her "woo-hoo!"
neu	-ing and shouting...and yelling "Yeah!"
neu	"OOOOoow!"
neu	during the dance moves.
neu	It really felt to me like Kathy was in "aerobics class" persona, just wearing a fancy costume.
neu	During the fast portion of the workout, it is almost as if Kathy can't hear the music.
neu	She has no natural rhythm, and frequently gets off beat with the music.
neu	What I found funny about this, is that Ansuya and the other dancers refused to follow her and this point, and continued to dance WITH the rhythm and Kathy is left doing her own thing.
neu	The costumes and sets were gorgeous...but a her whooping wolf calls, bad dancing, and total lack of knowledge of belly dance in general can't be covered up with "pretties".
neu	There should also have been a brief rundown of proper posture in the beginning before starting and there was not.
neu	It only takes a minute to do this...and it is important to properly execute some of the moves.
neu	Other than the moves she learned from Ansuya, I would venture to say that Kathy doesn't know a doumbek from a zil...or a beledi from a karshlima.
neu	Trust me...you want someone who DOES. To sum it up...Kathy saw the popularity in the Veena/Neena and Rania bellydance videos-and decided to jump on the bandwagon to make a few bucks.
neu	The only problem is that belly dance is an actual art form and takes a lot of training to execute.
neu	She took a couple belly dance classes and then put out a video.
neu	Sheesh. Ansuya should have known better than to sign on with this...because I actually think less of her now for putting her name on this one.
neu	I understand completely that this is marketed as an "exercise" video, and is not a professional dance instructional.
neu	However, most belly dance exercise videos (such as those from Suhaila, Rania, Veena & Neena, etc.) are by women who have a lot of Middle Eastern dance experience-not by someone who just decided to "make a video" on it, but has no experience at all.
neu	To teach Middle Eastern dance in any form-a real dance video, or an exercise video-you should know how to do it yourself.

neu	I have worked with this head now for almost three years.
neu	We use it in an art repro setup and it is the only way to go.
neu	We have to zig-align the camera so the film (actually BL scan back) and the plane of the art are aligned exactly.
neu	The gear movements on this heavy duty head are smooth and very precise.
neu	I could align the camera this accurately with out it.

neu	This is a nice stereo, but the product specs are off.
neu	When I bought this the specs said that this has a tape player.
neu	It really doesn't.
neu	It does however play five cds, has an aux input and is XM ready.
neu	I'm not that far advanced for XM. I'm in the cassette tape stone ages.
neu	If anyone is looking for the ultimate cassette tape player, I would suggest the JVC Kaboom Box. It has great sound and auto reverse.
neu	Anyway, back to the Sony. This is perfect for my computer.
neu	I play it through the Aux in and it sounds way better than the cheesy speakers in my monitor.
neu	It plays 5 cd's with modes like shuffle, repeat and random.
neu	So, if you care about cassette player this stero is very reliable and sounds good too.

neu	I've been a Neil Finn fan practically my whole adult life.
neu	First I become exposed to his brilliance via I Got You, the break through song of Split Enz a quarter of a century ago.
neu	That album, True Colours, is jam packed with great melodies and fun arrangements.
neu	Although their later albums did not match that peak, they were still enjoyable.
neu	When Crowded House became huge, I liked their albums ever more.
neu	Their first one, despite including the classic Don't Dream It's Over, is their least interesting one but during the final album, Together Alone, Neil Finn and Crowded House were making among the best music of that era.
neu	I was obviously very excited when Neil Finn released (Try Whistling) this album; what would he deliver this time being alone and apparently with all the freedom to experiment?
neu	Before hearing the album in its entirety, I heard She Will Have Her Way and Sinner, both great tracks and worthy classics.
neu	She Will is a straight forward song in a Beatles-esque fashion whilst Sinner is a dark moody track with a haunting rhythm.
neu	Sadly, these were the only tracks worth any attention.
neu	The production of the album is very flat, everything very professional like but lacking an edge.
neu	The songs really never come to life.
neu	I tried several times listening to the album, hoping I would get it, but no, this is for me an album that lacked a creative spark, something I can't say about anything else I had heard by Neil Finn (his next studio album, live album and recent one with his brother are for example much better).
neu	Actually, this is the only Neil Finn release that has not been a favorite of mine.
neu	It is interesting but this album gets high marks from many reviewers, actually most reviewers.
neu	My sister and one of my best friends are also big Neil Finn fans.
neu	Their reaction to this album was, however, almost identical to mine, close to being boring and not living up to expectations.
neu	It was also a commercial failure so it will remain a mystery to me how many people enjoy it.
neu	My advice, however, is to leave this one alone and listen to practically everything else by Neil Finn.

neu	[***SPOILER***] Where do all these positive comments come from?
neu	Does Valve hire or pay people to rate this game with an average of 9?!? Come on!
neu	This can't be serious.
neu	Any (even just a little experienced) gamer who actually played this game must be disappointed.
neu	All the people I have spoken to in my neighbourhood think alike and somehow all the people here are EP1-addicted/fanatics?
neu	Where have you all been in the past few years?
neu	When you rate this EP1 with a 10 what were CoD (2), Battlefield (2), FEAR and HL2 then.....a 25??! Yes the graphics are great, just as they were in HL2 (ok HDR is added and it does look nice, but it's not that much of a difference).
neu	The weapons are ok....and exactly the same as in HL2. The monsters are ok....just as they were in HL2. Well, they did add one whole new monster.
neu	Some 'genious' used almost a year to come up with a....ZOMBIE!
neu	It's just a fatter and faster version of the standard-zombie from HL2. How refreshing.
neu	Did they become smarter?
neu	No...not at all.
neu	They just come rushing towards you.
neu	It feels like my duty to inform potential buyers.
neu	PLEASE go and play the game at a store or at an friends place.
neu	It surely ain't worth the $20,-. Even at 'difficult' you will probably be able to end this game in about 2-3 hours.
neu	Do you pay for an superb new concept with fantastic eyecandy, great gameplay and AI?
neu	No....you pay $20,- for 3 hours 'more of the same'.
neu	Please Valve: Stop just making money....start making great games/expansions again.

neu	So I have only ever read the first Harry Potter book but never continued with the rest of the series since I didn't find the first book all that well written.
neu	However after really enjoying myself with the latest Harry Potter film and going to see the movie with two female fans in their 30's who swear by the books I thought I'd give Rowling another shot and read the 6th book in the series.
neu	I must admit, my initial hesitation was unwarranted.
neu	Rowling's come a long way, her writing is quite eloquent now.
neu	Rowling weaves a fascinating story that I can see why countless children and teens live by and love the Harry Potter series, making it their generational mantra.
neu	However as an adult, I don't get why so many adults like this series.
neu	It's a fun read, but nothing more, nothing different than what I've read countless times in other fantasy works, just now with children protagonists.
neu	The main problem I have with Potter in the books is that he doesn't really have much say over his life, re-active rather than pro-active.
neu	The key to a great hero in my opinion is that right or wrong, they make their own decisions and must live with the outcome of their own choosing.
neu	Potter in the movies is that type of hero, choosing to stand by, honoring the words of his teacher, however Potter in the books is trapped and can't move so instead of choosing he just accepts, he's left with all the choices taken away from him.
neu	That's the key difference on why while a fun read, I don't think this book is all that successful, especially compared to the movie.
neu	Young Adult fiction has really changed.
neu	It's amazing to think that Chronicles of Narnia, Lord of the Rings and The Golden Compass are young adult books especially when compared to the modern crop.
neu	They dealt with religion, the concepts of reincarnation, soul identifying, and rebirth.
neu	Tastes have changed and that's understandable, we live in a different generation now that doesn't necessarily want something underneath the surface of the words on the page.
neu	And that's fine, it's just that as I mentioned before while I can understand why children love these books, I can't understand why adults are feverish for them as well because at least with this book, there are a lot of faults within the fantastic storytelling.

neu	ANNAPOLIS (2006) ** James Franco, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Donnie Wahlberg, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Roger Fan, Wilmer Calderon, Brian Goodman, Chi McBride, Charles Napier. (Dir: Justin Lin) "An Officer and A Gentleman Lite" Annaplolis, the renowned US Naval Academy, is the subject of the titular film about a working-class kid from the wrong side of the tracks whose dream to become a Navy officer is fulfilled when he is offered a chance at basic training.
neu	The young man, Jake Huard (Franco) once was praised by his beloved late mother that one day he would attend the institution and become a man in the process.
neu	All the years of his backbreaking work with his contractor father Bill (Goodman) has him burning inside and expressing his frustrations by boxing at amateur bouts in town until one day he catches the eye of Lt.Cmdr. Burton (Wahlberg doing a mean Ed Harris imitation) who offers young Jake a shot at redemption.
neu	Once there Jake learns the hard way that it won't be a cake-walk by any means with an attendee Marine instructor named Cole (Gibson, seemingly miscast) who makes things hell for the recruits as expected and his hear on hold when he is at first shot down in a civilian bar by Ali (silky Brewster looking like a latter- day Ali McGraw), who turns out to be one of his superiors as well on base (and a boxing instructor to boot too).
neu	Along for the ride are the atypical stock characters - the know-it-all loudmouth Estrada (Calderon), the fat black kid Twins (Shannon) and the suck-up jerk Loo (Fan) - and quicker than you can say "An Officer and A Gentleman" - Huard looks like he may wash-out but on his extended leave at Christmas time he decides to tough it out and get his props by shooting for a shot at a heavyweight division bout with - that's right you guessed it - Cole!
neu	If you can gather that this is pure Hollywood hokum formulaic military maverick wanting a chance to redeem himself than don't bother buying a ticket (or wait for the inevitable DVD rental).
neu	The film is on automatic from the get go yet Franco's charm and the easy on the eyes Brewster make the melodrama go down smoother than anticipated and there is some humor sprinkled in for good measure.
neu	It's hard to believe this is director Lin's follow-up from his remarkable debut with the indie fave "Better Luck Tomorrow" but if you're gonna sell out it could be a lot worse.

neu	"Almost, but not quite" The game has a feel to it like CoV (the quest/mission instance's)but with out the quickness and fun.
neu	What I really didnt like about it was that the quests (the large ones) don't end with one dungeon.
neu	Allot of them have continuation's and a peep feels obligated to finish the whole series of quests in one go, with the rest of his group (what i mean by that is not letting your friends down by dropping out befour its done).
neu	Even if it means being up till 6:00 when u halfta work the next morning at 8:00 or 9:00:( The game also takes a real long time to lvl in compareason with other morgs with a really low cap (I could get a char to lvl 15-20 or so in WOW in the time it would take me to get to lvl 2-4 in DDO. But I imagine i could get a couple of chars to lvl 10 in DDO in the time it would get a char in WOW to lvl 60) So it takes a while to get going in DDO where other MMORGS let u get some early lvls fairly easy to get u hooked(interested) Where as DDO u are a wimp for a long time whitch isnt fun.
neu	I think DDO will go the way of all turbine's other MMORG AC2 but allot quicker than AC2 did as AC2 was fun to play at least for a bit.
neu	Looks great, to many bugs and to reliant on grouping (weak chars) only a couple chars can solo.

neu	Why did I pick up this book?
neu	- because the cover caught my eye and I'm always interested in urban-fantasy novels where the main protagonist is male (since that's very rare), especially one from a female author.
neu	So that really peaked my interest.
neu	The Dark Storm is the first book in a new urban-fantasy series from author Kris Greene and while it does have some decent writing, it is amazingly generic.
neu	It's almost like what if you took a bunch of stuff from other books- a world of demons, agents of light, vampires, goblins, knights, werewolves and mystical weapons of power, blended them all together and weaved the story around the template on "how-to" write an urban-fantasy novel.
neu	If this was any more by-the-numbers I would have sworn I'd read it already.
neu	The main problem I had with this book is it's characterization, or lack there of.
neu	There's just way to many characters crammed into this slim work (the story constantly shifts through multiple POV's), that I felt like I was missing half the novel, like it was incomplete.
neu	There's a sequel to The Dark Storm as there generally is with this sub-genre, but that's no excuse to have such a flimsy table setter.
neu	I mean you want readers to come back for the rest of the series right?
neu	Also, the two "main" characters of the book, Gabriel Redfeather and De Mona Sanchez (and yes that's her real name!!)
neu	are so poorly formed as characters that they feel like they're cursory characters in the background, rather then the one's the whole series is based around.
neu	And they both whined and whined so much, especially Gabriel, that I had to re-read the earlier pages and remind myself that he wasn't a freshman in highschool, but already in college!!!
neu	However, I did like the magic system with the witches, warlocks and mages all having different functions in the world, and how there are numerous classes and castes within each magical house.
neu	I also liked the back story of how there was a holy war centuries ago between the forces of light and the denizens of hell, and how the ancestors of both sides are fighting over the souls again years later.
neu	But man, the most important aspect of the story, the very foundation the world is based around, the magical weapons, felt the weakest in the entire story.
neu	Their characteristics and attributes are never fully thought out and explained, their powers appearing more as poor imagination rather than weapons that can control the very fabric of the world.
neu	It's all just so generic that in 2 weeks I probably won't remember the story anymore and sadly I won't be coming back for the upcoming sequel Demon Hunt.

neu	Got these speakers for X-mas.
neu	They sounded a little flat at first; plenty of midrange and bass but weak in the highs (compared to the Harman Champaigne Glass model which came with my PC).
neu	There's no treble control on the unit.
neu	I also own JBL Creatures which look and sound awesome plus have bass and treble control knobs on the sub.
neu	Of course the sound of either system can be adjusted via the equalizer in your Real or Windows Media Players.
neu	Back to the I-trigues; the more I listened to them, the better they started to sound.
neu	As I read in another post, there seems to be a break-in period.
neu	The soundstage has gotten wider and the sound, more detailed; quite unbelievable considering the narrow profile of the speakers.
neu	I like the wired remote w/ volume and bass controls & headphone and line-in jacks.
neu	Again a treble control would have been nice though.
neu	Overall, very impressive speakers.
neu	They also look great next to my 20" monitor w/ their tall slender appearance.

neu	If you thought PULSE was bad, OOOH just you wait!
neu	They made a sequel!
neu	If you did happen to see these both, you may at least recognize some of the actors in the first one, however this movie only was supplied with some of the worst.
neu	If acting was a draw- back, then understanding what they where talking about was another story.
neu	It also used the pleasantly Awful blue screen, where the backdrop...
neu	well looked as fake as it was....
neu	While it was vivid and layered with parts atop of another, the actors looked washed-out and out of proportion.
neu	Even though I didn't LIKE the first movie, this one just sets another bar!
neu	To add, the plot is TERRIBLE, and questionable.
neu	And what's up with the father calling his daughter 'squirt'?
neu	It was obnoxious and corny, and given the circumstances I wouldn't appreciate it...
neu	And the naked girl....
neu	obviously just wanted that thrown in there to widen their target market, and make us laugh even harder they added a fat man jumping off a bridge.
neu	Seriously, don't waste your money or your time on this movie like I unfortunately did.

neu	I've been using the Treo 700W for three months and I absolutely love the set of features it offers.
neu	The wireless sync for email/calendar/contacts/notes with the desktop works perfectly.
neu	The media player, wireless internet connection and camera are nice too.
neu	I can create play lists in Windows Media Player on my desktop and when I connect the Treo using the USB cable my play lists are automatically synced to the storage card.
neu	I have two major complaints about this phone.
neu	First of all, it's like Windows 95 -- I have to "reboot" it every day -- and I don't have any extra software installed other than what comes with the phone.
neu	People will frequently tell me they called and got voice mail but my phone did not ring -- when I try to turn on the phone it won't turn on.
neu	I have to remove the battery cover and use the stylus to push the reset button.
neu	If it's going to lock up that much, at least they should make the reset button more easily accessible.
neu	Second, my favorite feature, the voice commands, frequently just doesn't work.
neu	When it does work it's incredible -- you push the button on the wired headset and say the right command and you can play music, call any one of your contacts, and I believe you can do other things I haven't tried yet.
neu	But 80% of the time you push the button and nothing happens.
neu	Very disappointing.

neu	It surprises me how this game is underrated!
neu	I was really surprised the first time I played it.
neu	Sadly, this game is not totally new if you already played the original Castlevania game on N64. They took the original C64 game they added more bosses, characters better graphics and new places to explore in the dark castle of count Dracula.
neu	But does it really matter...?
neu	No, since it's almost a brand-new game, they put so much new features that if you didn't like the old one, you're almost sure to put it in your top ten games after trying it.
neu	Even if this game is so underrated, even if so many people think this game is not really good, I'm going to tell you how this game can be great to play!
neu	Gameplay- You'll get the hand of the control really fast and you will finally begin your training as a vampire hunter!
neu	You can easily master your character after a while, so don't worry about the controls.
neu	The camera is also easy to master: you press the button it's assigned to and it will come right behind you.
neu	As for the game difficulty, it's not a really hard game, but it's no piece of cake!
neu	Like in most adventure games, there are enigmas, action and fighting.
neu	Some enigmas are quite hard to figure out, but the game is more based on action and fighting.
neu	You can get really frustrated, when it's the Xth time you fail killing X boss, or the Xth time you're trying to jump at the very same place, but if you are very patient you can always make it and have fun with the game.
neu	If you are a person who get scared really easily, you might find it a little scary...I did!
neu	Score: 10/10 Story - Count Dracula has again arisen: Cornell, a strong man-beast, ventures into Castlevania to find his kidnapped sister and to destroy Dracula.
neu	Pretty good story, and if it seems simple, don't worry; you will soon get into it.
neu	But it doesn't end here!
neu	Seven years after Cornell's quest, three warriors are also following his path, as the darkness arises again.
neu	Henry, a boy whom Cornell had saved, Reinhardt, a descendant of the Belmont bloodline, and Carrie, a girl with magical powers, also venture into Castlevania and each have their own story.
neu	In addition to Count Dracula, Cornell, Reinhardt and Carrie all have a second enemy who will taunt you during the game, so this is no boring story!
neu	Score: 10/10 Graphics - The graphics aren't the best I've ever seen, but they're still quite good looking, and they are by far better than average graphics.
neu	Some animations are quite bad, like people standing up or rolling out of the way, but the overall looks very good.
neu	Castlevania really looks like an old castle, and your characters are really well-designed.
neu	The places never look the same, which is a good point.
neu	The lightning effects are particularly good, and so does the fog.
neu	During night time, you can see the red moon up there in the sky, which looks almost real.
neu	The enemies look so real, you really think you have a three-headed dog in front of you:) Score: 9/10 Music/Sound - Though the music might get annoying (sometimes), it's still really great and it fits with the atmosphere of the place you are in. It really makes you ''get into the game''.
neu	There is all kind of music, and depending in which kind of place you are, you can get calm music or rock-like music.
neu	You will have all your time to enjoy it, as there is usually one different music for each different stage in the game.
neu	This makes the game even scarier.
neu	As for the sounds, they are almost perfect.
neu	The lightning sounds really good, and you can hear your character walking, attacking, getting hurt or dying and the enemies moaning, fighting, growling or yelling in pain after they take a hit or die (especially the vampires' death, it sounds so cool!).
neu	Score: 9.5/10 Play Time/Replayability - The good point about this is that you have four characters to complete the game with: each has to take a different path to complete their tasks, so the game will last quite a long time for even a good player.
neu	However, once you've done a stage with one of the character, you will most likely have to go through it again with another sooner or later: there are only two stages that are unique to one player: the others are going to have to be completed two, three or even four times, which makes the replay value not really good.
neu	Unless you're a huge Castlevania fan, you will surely get bored to do the same thing over and over again, so you might not want to play it again.
neu	It depends on how you like the game, but it took me a long time before I even got a little bored.
neu	Score: 8.5/10 Overall score: 9/10 Final Recommendation - Look for it, find it, buy it!!
neu	This game is hard to find, so you will have a hard time finding it.
neu	You're really going to love it, don't think his game is bad, 'cause it's good and you're going to enjoy it.
neu	So if you manage to get your hands on it: you just got one of the greatest game ever!

neu	Edios's latest instalment to the Tomb Raider franchise is spectacular, and one of this year's best games.
neu	Graphics - 9.5/10 Beautiful.
neu	From the glistening waterfalls to the detailed backgrounds to Lara herself, everything is awsome.
neu	Attention to detail is astonishing, from equipment appearing on Lara as you gain it, to the smoke from her guns, everything will leave you breathless.
neu	My only complaint is that lower end PCs cannot run next-gen graphics, therefore reducing the beauty of it all Audio - 10/10 The game's background music, although infrequent, appears just at the right time.
neu	The beautiful ambiance will make you feel like you're actually in the game.
neu	And even the voice acting is well done, with the occasional joke now and then.
neu	Good job Edios!
neu	Gameplay - 10/10 If you've played a previous Tomb Raider game, then the outcome is predictable: jumping around, shooting bad guys, and the occasional puzzle and boss fight.
neu	It's the execution that makes this game shine.
neu	No stat-building, no crappy jumps, and NO camera issues.
neu	Jumping will soon become natural, with the probability of barely making the ledge, requiring you to quickly save Lara via the action button.
neu	Shimmying, rolling, and swinging will soon become second nature(or else!).
neu	Gun combat also had a massive overhaul, requiring more strategy when engaging in combat.
neu	Enemies won't dodge attacks, but are still a big threat.
neu	Dodging, rolling, and new slo-mo combat will aid you greatly.
neu	Puzzles are not overly hard to figure out, but execution can be tricky.
neu	Some puzzles can be solved multiple ways, allowing for a varied challenge depending on your gameplay style.
neu	Overall, brilliant execution.
neu	Controls - 9/10 Although keyboard controls are a bit clunky, a 10$ PS2-style gamepad will fix this right up.
neu	Story - 8.5/10 As before, you have to raid tombs (hence the name), gaining the artifact inside.
neu	What sets this game apart from previous installments is the way it ties Lara's past into the mix, allowing for a slowly unraveling plot to appear.
neu	Not spectacular, but a damned fine effort Replay Value - 7/10 The game is quite short, but the hidden artifacts and unlockables (and a time trial mode), allows for many a redo.
neu	Overall - 9/10 The Good-Graphics, gameplay, and audio will blow you away.
neu	The Bad-Low end PCs can't run next-gen graphics; slightly clunky keyboard controls The Hell?!-Early in the game, you can hear the guards talking about a monkey smoking a cigarette.
neu	Weird. Buy or Rent-Buy. You'll want to keep this one for ages!
neu	A shinesprite56 review C 2006

books_neg_14
neu	I began this novel with the greatest of hopes, and finished it in an effort to fully understand what a really bad novel consists of.
neu	It is the story of a man in a mid-western town and a full description of every person he has ever met in the town.
neu	It held the promise of leading off into a sci-fi novel but didn't quite reach anything beyond the mundane until the last couple of chapters of the book.
neu	Reading the introductions to numerous sub-characters that had no relation to the plot (if there was one)was painfully boring and took up a good part of the book.
neu	The relationship between Michael (the main character) and Angela (a complete stranger he hops into bed with in the first chapter) is not only unplausable and mesogenistic it reads like the fantastic pipe-dream of a teenage boy.
neu	When the the main character finally reaches something vaguely interesting, the discovery of an alien corridor, he takes a break from uncovering it to go have a day at the art museum and shopping with his girlfriend.
neu	When he gets back to the corridor he is ready to dive in, and when he does so begins the only salvageable part of the book.
neu	Note to author: Reading doesn't have to be as painful as a dentist appointment.
neu	They say to write what you know, but keep in mind that plot is EVERYTHING, without one you are just meandering about frustrating your reader.

neu	Well i hate to be the only dissenter in an ocean of metal wannabe 12-16yr olds, but this album is an absolute joke.
neu	a complete rip-off and about as generic as it gets, it combines the most commercially viable aspect of Nirvana (loud guitars and screaming) with the down-tuned sound of Korn. Truely this band would do better to become a tribute band, which in many respects they are.
neu	Their image is also one of the most amusing things to emerge from the 'metal' scene in years.
neu	So obviously designed for kids, to allow them to shock mummy and daddy, i find it quite sad that 9 blokes decided to adopt this image to sell records.
neu	It is as manufactured as Britney, Steps 5ive etc, and on the same level musically.
neu	The whole mask and boiler siut thing also causes me no end of amusement, especially when they claim that it makes it more about the music, and not about their identities.
neu	Please! the image in many respects relegates the music to a secondary fuction.
neu	Just scroll down the reviews and see how many kidies have referred to their "disturbing" and "satanic" image.
neu	The songs are actually really bad as well, with the possible exception of Wait and bleed.
neu	As a whole, i would recomend bands such as Tool, AIC and other authentic metal rather than this sorry lot.
neu	manufactured anger, for a manufactured audience.
neu	And no kiddies, this is not being rebellious.

neu	Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent.
neu	This work of historical fiction explores the experiences of the women in relation to their men as well as the relationships between the women.
neu	The first half of the book is the story of Jacob's four wives: their love for the same man, their conflicts, and the bond between sisters and women.
neu	Each month the women join together in the red tent for several days.
neu	Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah . As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time.
neu	Througout the book we see that the women continue to practice their own religious beliefs, until a dramatic conflict with Jacob. In the second half of the book, the reader is able to catch a glimpse of Egyptian gods and godesses.
neu	However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.
neu	The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly.
neu	The portrayal of Joseph is a far cry from his broadway persona and there is little in the way of explanation for why he has become the greedy selfish man that he is.
neu	Dinah's sotry ends with a bitterswee tone.
neu	After seeing her family from afar at her father's death, she receives some sense of reconciliation from the family that remains.
neu	After returning to Egypt, Dinah dies surrounded by loved ones and returns to her waiting mothers.
neu	The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on.

neu	THE ICE HARVEST (2005) *** John Cusack, Billy Bob Thornton, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Platt, Randy Quaid, Mike Starr. Black Comedy For Those Not In The Holiday Spirit John Cusack has always been one of the few actors who merit the Gold Standard when it comes to watching a film for pure entertainment and he excels with his good-hearted average guy manner in an unlikely dark comedy with another actor who is also in the same league of criteria, Billy Bob Thrornton (both co-starred in 1999's "Pushing Tin" a sort of satirical comedy about air traffic controllers at each other's throats) and together they make a fine comic duo.
neu	The post noir plot has to do with Kansas City 'mob lawyer' Charlie Arglist (Cusack) and his acquaintance Vic Cavanaugh (Thornton) ripping off one of Charlie's clients, Bill Guerrard (Quaid), by skimming some $2M in change and heading for warmer climes then the titular weather condition that serves as a character in itself in causing things to get slippery in their grand scheme of the high life on a chilly Christmas Eve in Wichita Falls. Charlie doesn't have much luck: his wife has left him for his best friend Pete van Heuten (scene stealer Platt) who keeps turning up like a bad (drunken) penny throughout the festive evening while Charlie's doubts of the perfect crime getting gummed up as he fears his (rightful) paranoia that Bill will catch wind of their theft and finds solid evidence that he is right in the form of Bill's henchman Roy (Starr) who keeps showing up moments after Charlie has arrived at say a strip club bar he frequents.
neu	To add fuel to the conflagration brewing is Renata (Nielsen channeling Veronica Lake replete with that icon's peekabo 'do), the sexily mysterious owner of the nudie bar Charlie keeps seeking refuge in and has the not-so-original idea of running away with the femme fatale in the process.
neu	What makes all this funny is Cusack's deadpan at the absurdities that seem to pop up every ten minutes making their unlikely reality a surreality.
neu	His timing is right on the money and Thornton's prickly, misanthropic (and homicidal) Vic is the perfect off-balance to the dicey proceedings at hand causing the two men to wade hip deep in a mire of dead bodies and other unsavory situations.
neu	Told in an icy comic vein by master veteran funnyman Harold Ramis who deftly directs the sordid and humorous sequences with aplomb and some interesting shots along the way (I particularly liked the off-center POV of a shotgun cartridge during one of the climactic action sequences very much so) as well as letting his cast simply let the smart screenplay by vets Richard Russo and Robert Benton sail along in the adaptation of Scott Phillips' Jim Thompsonian pulp fiction with just the right amount of bite and bile executed.
neu	Cinematographer Alar Kivilo's blue-black schematics make you feel the stinging cold of the Midwest bleakness engulfing the characters' plight.
neu	For anyone who has loathed the holiday season and all its trappings this makes a fine piece of coal in a stocking of cinematic mirth and mayhem.

neu	First of all, let me elaborate on the term "melodic death metal".
neu	I do not mean "Gothenburg" bands, but more accurately, Death Metal that contains some melody.
neu	Now that we've got that out of the way...
neu	Anata is one of those rare bands that hasn't yet written a bad song.
neu	While most people are only familiar with their third album, "Under A Stone With No Inscription", I'm here to tell you that this album is every bit as worthy of praise.
neu	"Released When You Are Dead" opens the album in a deceptive manner, as it is easily the most brutal song on the album.
neu	It is still quality though, with a massive slow riff in the middle.
neu	From here the songs become more melodic, with vocalist/guitarist/main man Fredrik Shalin alternating between growled and screamed vocals.
neu	The third song, "Under Azure Skies", deserves a paragraph of its own.
neu	This, my friends, is one of the best metal songs I've ever heard, period.
neu	Battery.
neu	Angel Of Death. Davidian.
neu	Heartwork.
neu	Blinded By Fear. Under Azure Skies. It deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as these classics.
neu	Beginning with slow, chugging riffs, it is after the first verse that it kicks into high gear, harmonies running rampant.
neu	But then the song breaks down into a bass-led melody, with Schalin at first almost speaking the lyrics, then screaming over the soft music.
neu	I'm butchering the description, but it's really a powerful piece.
neu	The song picks up again with more heart-wrenching harmonies, screams and pounding drums.
neu	Simply godly.
neu	I could go on and on about this wonderful album, but I won't.
neu	Instead, I'll just leave you to check out some of the music, and then maybe you'll buy it.
neu	Recommended like a rest after a hard day's work.

neu	PSYCHO (1960) **** Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Simon Oakland.
neu	The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye.
neu	The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!)
neu	by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.
neu	Best line: "Mother isn't , what's the term?
neu	Herself today".

neu	I think most people decide to go with a DSLR because they've got a friend with one that takes fantastic pictures and they want to get that themselves.
neu	I knew going in that I would have to learn how to use it.
neu	I bought this camera on sale for $399 and hard a really hard time getting good pics out of the camera.
neu	I think out of hundreds of pics I took while I had it, I thought 3 were really good.
neu	I bought a telephoto lens to see if that would help but it didn't.
neu	The pictures had no color, were not sharp, and terrible DOF. I probably could have been able to eventually use it to its fullest potential but I want good photos now.
neu	I finally took this one back and decided on a Nikon D90. I am going to get in in a week (come on Amazon!)
neu	It's a lot more but I think if you really want a dslr it's because you want GREAT pics, not just pics that are better than a point and shoot.

neu	I really hate to say it, because i think Ani Difranco is awesome, but this album is very bad.
neu	At best, it sounds like some cleaned up B-Sides. She probably should have worked hard on a few songs rather than not putting very much into all of the songs on this album.
neu	I tried to like this album, and it's definently hard admitting it to myself that Ani put out a bad album, but she has.
neu	This album more or less sucks.
neu	None of the songs stand out from each other.
neu	They all sound like experiments that weren't seen through from start to finish.
neu	Unlike bands like Radiohead, David Bowie, The cure etc. that have worked very hard moving their sound into new territory, Ani just gave a half-a$$ effort and it shows.

neu	Conquest of Space came out about 5 years after Destination Moon which was another George Pal production.
neu	The story takes place what looks to be about 1965-70. Aboard a space station in orbit around the earth, a Captain and his son are in charge of building a spaceship.
neu	They are later told that the ship is to be sent on a mission to the planet Mars. Along the way the Captain gradually loses his mind and causes the ship to crash.
neu	They spend the better part of a year trying to survive until the orbit of Mars is close enough to return to earth.
neu	While the special effects have improved since Destination Moon (there is some use of blue screen, using full scale sets)and quite impressive, the story lacks quite a bit in terms of plot.
neu	Also, it is very similar to DM. Still it is somewhat enjoyable and features a diverse cast (look fast for the black crewman way in the back!)

neu	Just when we thought synth-pop was dead and buried, the grizzled top end of Gen X decides it can't let go and nominates this Norwegian guy to rescue everything that was good about syth-eighties-dance (the romantic lyricism and desparing sense of "death tomorrow") and lose everything that was bad (the overly-romantic lyricism and androgynous tweek of casios "on the metro").
neu	Apoptygma Berzerk gets better with each album, artfully programming a solid pop sensibility with cutting edge danceteria and gothadustrial seasonings.
neu	*Welcome to Earth* is a no holes barred pop dance explosion of the romantic strain (more akin to camoflage, depeche mode, and alphaville than moby, prodigy or ministry), but offers up no limp wrists.
neu	Almost every track is amazing and of the sort which one wishes went on for another five minutes.
neu	A good corrective for Covenant fans who won't let go of the casios.
neu	Groth's use of female vocals and KORGs works much, much better.
neu	Need to dance and sing too?
neu	This album is it for 2000!

neu	I must by saying Universal Studios is a fantastic theme park but the game just offends it.
neu	I doubt the producers have ever been to it.
neu	And since when did Universal Studios have a quiz game?
neu	It also puzzles me about the character selection because nobody has high speed or anything so there is really no need.
neu	Read on to see what else makes this game unplayable.
neu	GRAPHICS 4/10 All Gamecube games have exceptionally good graphics, but this sadly will remind you of the chunky, low polygon rate graphics of Nintendo 64. As this was the first Gamecube game I played I thought of selling my Gamecube (but then I played Star Fox Adventures).
neu	Like when you try cuddle Frankenstien, you don't cuddle him, you get impaled on his arm and you get 200 points or so (you would expect it to subtract points wouldn't you?)
neu	and then the controller unexpectedly rumbles.
neu	I also went right through a bench once.
neu	And I also find myself running through a lot of people.
neu	MUSIC & SOUND EFFECTS 0/10 The starting music is mute pressing material and when you get into the actual game, it does not change.
neu	It is impossible to survive the music, even though there is very little of it, when it happens you will be sorry that you did not mute.
neu	It would be good if there was actual music for the regular gameplay.
neu	GAMEPLAY 0/10 I would give this a something if I knew how to enter the games!
neu	The gameplay is not worthy of anything.
neu	There is no clear entry to a game (except when the person says: '' Here it is, have fun!
neu	''). And you earn points for things that you don't even see.
neu	They tried to make a good item system, but they unfortunately failed, and quite miserably may I add?
neu	The games are too quest based and if the rides were just rides then, it may have received a six or even a seven, but the gameplay stopped it from getting a 4. OVERALL 3/10 This game is amazingly unique, but the gameplay, graphics, music and sound effects ruin it.
neu	It seems that the uniqueness and potential were, unfortunately, not enought to save the game.
neu	It would also help if there were clear instructions on how to enter games and I can imagine a lot of people getting horribly frustrated or aggravated, angry or upset about not being able to enter the games.
neu	RENT OR BUY?
neu	Neither, I got this with my Game Cube so I did not fall for any traps.
neu	If you want good rides, go to Universal Studios, do not buy this, it just does not cut it.
neu	If you are looking for a game buy Star Fox Adventures or Mario Party 6, not this.
neu	So on a final note don't buy this, it had a lot of potential and is quite unique but still couldn't convince me that it was a good game.
neu	Clear instructions, realistic rides and better graphics would of made this 7 to 10 out of 10 material, but because this is everything the game is missing it unfortunately won't impress.
neu	Sincerely signed, gummybearz2000

neu	"Disappointing" The overall storyline of the game is held together by poor one-liners.
neu	The storyline is flat and uninventive.
neu	utterly disappointing.
neu	Asside from the storyline you have missions to complete.
neu	The only thing that holds these missions in context is the thin storyline, so it ends up being a mission-based arena game, with the difference that the arena maps are a bit larger than traditional arena games.
neu	The fighting is pretty uninventive, unless I totally missed the point.
neu	You basically have spells and weapons, then hack and slash your way through the enemies to the bosses.
neu	Finish the boss, move on to the next mission.
neu	The visuals aren't to bad, but then again, they're nothing new.
neu	Considering the relatively small size of the maps, the graphic detail could have been seriously improved.
neu	Even the special effects are lacking.
neu	I guess the sound wasn't too bad, but nothing out of the ordinary.
neu	If you want to play this, I recommend you rent it at the local Blockbuster.
neu	Don't buy it, its a waste of money.

neu	"All flash, no substance" Only get this game if you really, really, really love the trilogy.
neu	Not to be misconstrued I love the story of the one ring, the hobbit is also very entertaining, however this game is just a cheap and uninspired leech that gets all it's inspiration from the motion picture.
neu	I sat through hours and hours of the epic films (including the extended versions) the fragments they through in with this game are just, how you say LAME!
neu	In summary I dislike it immensly, also downloaded the demo for the second one.
neu	The demo for battle for middle earth two has more to it than this whole game.
neu	I might be considered a bit bias because in my experience I enjoy games in the 1st or 3rd person point of veiw a bit more.

neu	I had originally purchased the Motorola S9 HD headset from the apple store, but took it back because I thought there might be something better.
neu	So I bought the Sony Bluetooth Headset like the one above.
neu	Anyway, as soon as I strapped these things on, I realized that I made a big mistake.
neu	The Sony BT Headset has great sound quality, but who designed the size of this thing?
neu	It's awful!
neu	The band that goes around the back of your head is not adjustable, and if you are wearing a collar of any sort, when you move your head at all, it will rub and move the ear buds in and out of your ears.
neu	If you want a headset for the gym like I do, then stay away from these - unless you have a head the size of Shrek. The ring around the back of your head that connects the earpieces is about 2 full inches from your head/neck.
neu	Terrible design.

neu	Only at the repeated insistence of my friend A. did I sit down and *really* listen to this album.
neu	I must admit that I regard much contemporary r&b and hip-hop with skepticism because of the same lack of individuality that is rife in the boy-band repertoire.
neu	Anything with high praise on a big label (eg Columbia)--especially anything that gets high praise in "awards" shows, must be sub par.
neu	Lauryn Hill knows this--and sings about it ("Superstar")--and produces an album that *she* wanted.
neu	The result is anything but ordinary.
neu	Her voice is silky and direct, and her lyric smart and direct.
neu	This is pure soul--its naked bearing, its deep hurt, its highest joys.
neu	The song, "To Zion," merits owning the album alone.
neu	In this tribute to her son Hill brings the listener to tears and expresses in a few short minutes what soul music is really about--its essence; a mother of music, indeed.
neu	Simply amazing.

neu	Don't get me wrong, the graphics and sound in this game are some of the best on PS2 but neither one of these factors matters when you don't have good gameplay.
neu	Sure you can fine tune your car and buy all kinds of parts for it, but is that really what a racing game is all about?
neu	When it comes to the racing part of the game, the handling of the cars is totally unforgiving leaving you with a hard and frustrating simulation.
neu	The gameplay is pretty much repetitive and the tracks are boring.
neu	This game gets dull very fast since you'll find yourself racing one competition event over and over to earn just enough money to buy that extra engine part that you want.
neu	If you want a fast paced, fun, exciting, and non-repetitive game, then get Burnout 2 or Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2. These two games have a lot more different game modes that will keep you busy for hours while your Gran Turismo 3 sits on the shelf.

neu	I grew up as a huge Steve Englehart fan, reading many of the comics he wrote from Captain America to Detective Comics. So when I heard that his 1981 novel Point Man was finally seeing print again, I jumped at the chance to buy it.
neu	While many of his comic work feels dated at times, this early Urban Fantasy (because what else can I call it?)
neu	still feels fresh, amazingly so when I think what an early take on the Urban Fantasy genre this is.
neu	However, while not feeling dated, I don't think this is a particularly successful work.
neu	It has a nice premise, of ancient battles with wizards fought using a basis in astrology and ancient "scientific" arts, but I never found myself totally engrossed in the story.
neu	Perhaps it's because I've now spent years reading work similar to Point Man, which may have felt fresh 20 years ago but now feels a bit stale.
neu	I never really felt connected to the main character, and I found myself 150 pages in on the verge of that ever prescient feeling for a reader (do I keep going or drop it), but since it's only about 300 pages long I figured why not keep going.
neu	It got better, but not enough to warrant wanting to read the sequel Long Man which just came out.
neu	Let me say this though, a sequel to a book which came out almost 20 years ago?
neu	Kudos to Mr. Englehart for continuing the story.
neu	So yeah, a book with interesting concepts that I don't think was executed all that well.
neu	If you're new to the Urban Fantasy genre then you may like this one, otherwise it's a pass.
neu	2.5/5 stars.

neu	Pros: Long range zoom for distance and nature shooting.
neu	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
neu	This Nikon P90 was purchased for its 24X zoom in a small compact package.
neu	Living next to a large body of water I can shoot ducks, tow boats, Osprey, anything else, at distances of 100 yards and even further.
neu	This is best done on a tripod to eliminate shake and to keep the object centered.
neu	Truly the 24X zoom is superb in replacing expensive long lens of the best quality.
neu	The camera is light but feels solid.
neu	Controls are intuitively where fingers are placed.
neu	The vibration reduction cannot be faulted even at maximum zoom.
neu	It must be one of the best anti shake designs made.
neu	Rapid fire makes for great pics of birds in flight and sports shots.
neu	The P90 exceeds my expectations.

neu	Pawn the jewelry, if necessary, to buy this disc if only for "Je t'ai dans la peau" ("I've got you under my skin").
neu	I heard it for the first time when I put the disc in the car player and I was knocked for a loop.
neu	It's a classic Edith Piaf song, but this interpretation marries all of Karin Clercq's best qualities in one track: a beautifully alto voice, incredibly clear diction, and a gorgeous Belgian accent.
neu	There's a strident guitar backup and a little subtle synthesizer in the background.
neu	The rest of the songs, original compositions all, are a little less stellar.
neu	The songs range all over the map, from female-power affirmations "Ne Pas" to the lust-at-first-sight of "Désir." It's a good record for those who are learning French, because it comes with a lyric booklet and her diction is so clear.

neu	EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, Wanda Sykes, John Michael Higgins, Jonah Hill, Molly Shannon, Ed Helms, (Cameo: Jon Stewart as himself) Strained 'sequel' to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with Carell's jerk anchorman Evan Baxter leaving TV to begin his stint as a freshman Congressional rep has his hands full when God (Freeman reprising his holy role; Jim Carrey wisely avoided the 'calling') demands he build an ark like Noah and the hilarity ensues (or should have).
neu	The Godforsaken sitcom-y script by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's amiable persona transcends his vain Evan into something resembling a human being.

neu	Having just finished a long journey through "The Cloister Walk" I do not consider myself at all qualified to provide an objective review of "The Psalms".
neu	But the in-depth commentary on the Psalms, the saints, the Church, on liturgy and theology..and especially the people of the monastic world..
neu	which was so very prominent in her "Walk" is missing.
neu	To compare is, of course, patently unfair.
neu	However, in my opinion a book's value is not in merely restating what has already been written, but in the creative contributions to and interpretations of what already is.

neu	In an earlier review I had stated that TD's "Melrose" was their most haunting since this one.
neu	Well "Hyperborea" is their absolute most haunting an surreal cd ever in my book.
neu	It really does, as reviewer Morse put it, take you on a visual journey-you really do feal like you are there.
neu	I actually imagined myself amongst the pyramids and the Sphynx on the track 'Sphynx Lightening'.
neu	And on the title track, 'Hyperborea', I could see myself on a barren yet breath-taking frozen landscape.
neu	If you like a surreal sound, this is the one for you.
neu	And yes, as reviewer Morse also stated, you do have to listen closely for the subtle changes in style and tone(just when you think you are hearing a Celtic sort of sound, it moves on to something else and it challenges you to try and figure it out).
neu	You could actually(and this may appall the most devout new age listeners!)consider "Hyperborea" 'nature music', for it does indeed transport you to natural locales and states of mind.
neu	Does that sound like someone on an acid trip?
neu	Just buy it and you'll understand.

neu	I went into this film with extremely low expectations giving that the original My Bloody Valentine is pretty much a mediocre film at best.
neu	Why do you think there weren't ever any sequels?
neu	So now, nearly 30 years later, we are given a remake/sequel.
neu	It just makes me wary.
neu	I have, however, been impressed with a few ("few" being the operative term) horror films of late, and decided to give it a go.
neu	Now, the "WTF is going on here" summary line isn't about the movie specifically, but the admission price.
neu	I live in Houston, Texas where the average evening-time ticket price is about $8 (and I can usually catch matinées for less than $4), but was sucker-punched with an $11.50 price for the ticket.
neu	Mind you, this was at a 4:30pm matinée!
neu	I understand the cost being higher to compensate for the 3D glasses, but they ask you to turn the glasses back in when you leave (under the guise of "thinking green", no less).
neu	Did I turn my glasses in?
neu	Hell no. For the most expensive matinée I've ever been to, I'm keeping a souvenir.
neu	If people in New York or Los Angeles or wherever else are stupid enough or resigned-to-the-fact-that's-what-prices-are enough to pay that much for a movie ticket, more power to them, but down here, that's pretty much highway robbery.
neu	Add to that, the general rudeness of people in the theater: (an example) two obnoxious girls sitting next to my friends and me (yes, that's correct, it's not "my friends and I") spent the entire movie text-messaging their friends.
neu	No kidding.
neu	Every minute and a half, there was a bright glare on the inside of my 3D glasses.
neu	Not the fault of the filmmakers or the theater, it just diminishes the experience.
neu	A note to rude people: TURN OFF YOUR F'N PHONES OR STAY THE HELL OUT OF THE THEATER.
neu	THERE ARE MORE PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD BESIDES YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS.
neu	YOU ARE NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVERYONE ELSE, NOR IS WHAT YOU HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WITH PEOPLE SO IMPORTANT THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO RUIN THE Movie-going EXPERIENCE FOR EVERYONE ELSE. A note to the two girls sitting in the back row at the 4:30 matinée of My Bloody Valentine 3D at the AMC 30 on I-45 and Beltway 8 in Houston on Saturday, January 17th 2009: YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW LUCKY YOU WERE THAT I WAS THERE. MY FRIEND IS A RECOVERING SKIN-HEAD WHO STILL HAS SOME OF HIS MORE OFF-THE-WALL TRAITS. YOU ALMOST LOST YOUR PHONE. NO KIDDING.
neu	IT'S JUST RUDE. Not that you care or anything.
neu	If you did, you wouldn't have been using them anyway.
neu	On to the movie...
neu	Considering a cast of relative unknowns and B- or C-list actors, the acting was decent.
neu	The writing was okay although there wasn't much of a story going on.
neu	Let's face it; the "who's the killer?
neu	is is guy-a or guy-b?"
neu	routine has been done 1000 times before and it's been done better.
neu	Way better.
neu	The gore/violence/schlock factor was high, but not the highest I've ever seen by any means, although most of it was done well.
neu	But, I still pine for the days of Tom Savini, Stan Winston and Dick Smith. Where's Greg Nicotero when you need him?
neu	Overall, I would say that My Bloody Valentine 3D is better than the original My Bloody Valentine, but still falls flat on its face when compared to the great horror films.
neu	It's just difficult to rate a movie with high stars if you have to pay three times as much to see it as you did for a better movie the week before.
neu	I hope the Friday the 13th remake is better.

neu	This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen, and anyone that has read the books will agree with me!
neu	If you have seen the movie I suggest you don't read the book because you will be so confused on what is happening.
neu	This movie skipped 3 whole city's and many, many main characters that were important to the story line.
neu	They also skipped many important events like Eragon's back getting slashed open by Durza and him hearing the cripple that is whole in his head.
neu	He was also then supposed to go to Elesmera to finish his training with the elves.
neu	Also, did you hear of anyone called Orik or Hothgar in the movie?
neu	No? Didn't think so!
neu	Hothgar was the dwarf king and Orik was Eragons best friend in the book.
neu	Oh, and remember the cool ugly smoke monster that Durza was riding (and let me point out that Durza never used magic when fighting Eragon in the book or he would have died for sure) Oh yeah, back to the smoke monster, it was never in the book!
neu	Durza was fighting Eragon under the star sapphire (that they also didn't mention) and then Ayra broke it with magic because she was helping Saphira with her broken armor and THAT'S when Saphira first used fire.
neu	Eragon then used Zar'roc (who's gem should have been a ruby not a sapphire because Morzans dragon was red) to kill Durza. Then there is the Razac!
neu	There were only two in the book!
neu	The reason Brom should have died is because they were chasing the Razac because Eragon wanted revenge on them killing Garrow (his uncle).
neu	He also never learned sword fighting from Ro'ran and the movie never showed him fighting with Brom. Also, would it have killed them to put in Katrina, Ro'rans girlfriend that gets kidnapped in Eldest by the (((2))) Razac!!!
neu	Then they never went to Tierm were he really met Angela (the fortune teller) and The Werecat Solumbun who tells him important information that they need to use in the third book.
neu	They also never met Jeod in Tierm who they need to help them find the Razac that they were chasing not running away from them.

neu	SWIMMING UPSTREAM (2005) *** Geoffrey Rush, Judy Davis, Jesse Spencer, Tim Draxl, David Hoflin, Craig Horner, Brittany Byrnes, Deborah Kennedy, Mark Hembrow, Mitchell Dellevergin, Thomas Davidson, Kain O'Keefe, Robert Quinn, Keeara Byrnes. (Dir: Russell Mulcahy) Rush and Davis give bold performances in this true-life account of Aussie swimming champ Tony Fingleton.
neu	Athletic biographies and films about sports in general seem to keep audiences enthralled as they line up to see them, rooting for the underdog and living vicariously through their triumphs as well as viscerally feeling their emotional (and physical) scars they accumulate in the long and winding road to success.
neu	In the latest true-life account the sport is swimming and the athlete is Australia's national champion Tony Fingleton circa the 1950s-early 1960s, beginning with his humble beginnings as the middle child of a family of five and clearly not his father's favorite as the story proceeds to illustrate just how blunt that fact is with some heartbreaking moments of just how difficult it can be to be a perfect athletic specimen, but an absolute zero in the eyes of a loved one.
neu	Tony's blue-collar working class dad, Harold (a superb Rush in a continuing string of chameleon like turns of late), a man who houses many demons and unleashes his inner fury through bottles of beer , tries his best to provide for his sprawling tight family and although his focus on winning-is-the-only-thing-that-matters view in life has to face his failures every day (he gave up a promising attempt as a professional soccer star by marrying young, and regretting every moment thereafter) in spite of his loving family and long-suffering wife Dora (the ethereally haggard Davis equally top-notch in a semi-low-key performance).
neu	His main cause of bitterness is apparently his son Tony's good-natured, loving self that only may mirror the phantoms of what Harold may have been (or could have been) and his reflection is only refracted back with disappointment until one day the young boy and his sibling John announce they can swim very well much to his surprise.
neu	Harold sees this magical moment as his ticket by coaching his lads gruelingly to stardom and becomes obsessed in their times by carrying his ubiquitous stop-watch at all times and having the boys go at the crack of dawn every day until they are young men equally scrabbling to make names of themselves (and eventually to disembark their trappings for the real world).
neu	Spencer gives a remarkably effective performance as the tortured Tony (as does Dellevergin as his younger version) attempting to shake off the waves of abuse and loathing from the only person he so desperately wants to make proud of and is ably supported by a more difficult turn by Draxl (and his younger counterpoint Davidson) as John. The two young brothers are thick and thin covering for each other when things get messy yet eventually a wedge is driven between the two by the conniving Harold who will stop at nothing to see his 'dream' the way it should be.
neu	The acting by both Rush and Davis is truly impressive as each manages to avoid making either of their roles true monsters and victims by giving them shades of gray in character and just enough reality to their pre-conceived stereotypes – alcoholic loser and misbegotten abused wife.
neu	Veteran director Mulcahy (HIGHLANDER) has a difficult task in keeping the film's pace relevant to the seemingly endless swim matches and his choice of pulsating music diminishes his clever wipes and split-screens to divvy up the emotional overload his characters are going through.
neu	Yet the screenplay by Anthony Fingleton - based on his biography with his younger sister Diane – keeps the storyline real in its brutality and shame.
neu	What easily could have been a waterlogged THE GREAT SANTINI the film achieves the unexpected: sympathy for a loser and new-found respect for a winner.

neu	WHITE NOISE (2004) ** Michael Keaton , Deborah Kara Unger, Chandra West, Ian McNeice, Sara Strange, Nicholas Elia, Keegan Connor Tracy. (Dir: Geoffrey Sax) Can You Hear Me Now?
neu	: The Movie What happens to the dearly departed once they leave this mortal coil is perhaps the most universally pondered query and cinema is no stranger in trying to come up with a significant reply.
neu	However in its latest incarnation the answer seems to be repetitive (ie we've seen it before).
neu	Submitted for your approval : One Jonathan Rivers (the always reliable Keaton), a successful architect whose second marriage to the beautiful and talented writer Anna (the fetching West) seems to be heading for nothing but good news when she announces she's pregnant moments before a photo shoot for her new novel.
neu	Sadly these will be the last fond memories Jonathan will treasure.
neu	Anna is killed in a freak accident while changing a tire she falls into the nearby waters and drowns leaving a distraught, grief-stricken husband who begins to question how can he possibly continue his life.
neu	Enter mysterious Brit Raymond Price (McNeice) who informs the overwhelmed Rivers that Anna has been 'speaking' to him in an ethereal device known as EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon) – communication thru the white noise static of audio devices and eventually a ghostly video format.
neu	Naturally Rivers is at first affronted and skeptical but then finds himself at Price's home where he is in the midst of 'session' with another begrieved client, Sarah Tate (the utterly sexy Unger).
neu	It is here where Rivers gets a sample of just what Price has been trying to explain which sets the plot line of the film.
neu	Rivers becomes obsessed and convinced he can make contact with his late wife and will stop at nothing – including his good mental health and further distancing from his first wife and child (Strange and Elia, respectively) in the process – until he stumbles upon some nefarious signals from the great beyond testing his thought process and eventually tapping into something that was perhaps best left alone.
neu	WHITE NOISE taps into many other (and better envisioned) sources of the ghostly genre including a score of old "Twilight Zone"'s, "POLTERGEIST", 'THE CHANGELING", "AUDREY ROSE", "THE SIXTH SENSE" and "THE RING" to name several off the top of my head.
neu	Namely how we the living try to comprehend the world of the dead and the afterlife (if one even does occur) and largely opening a Pandora's box of inexplicable evil while attempting to cope with one's own mortality.
neu	The screenplay by newcomer Niall Johnson makes the most of its "X-Files" approach and for the most part the familiarity falls into place predictably yet Brit TV vet Sax (making his big-screen directorial debut) also elicits a few jolts for good measure in the creaky vehicle for Keaton who arguably is the best thing about the film as a whole, down playing his normal kinetic fueled turns with a vastly introspective and amiably obsessed Rivers (you truly feel his pain and desperation invested by this consuming project he enlists to) and the underused (sadly) Unger makes a fine fellow traveler downplaying her sexy visage.
neu	Kudos also to a viscerally uneasy turn by the lush Connor Tracy (late of "FINAL DESTINATION 2") as a blind medium in a scene that begs for more screen time development.
neu	The film however falls apart in the climactic final moments, which allows the next film in line to continue the quest for What Happens When We Die; only time will tell.

neu	Genres and sub-genres annoy me.
neu	I know they're a necessary evil, and that they help the less industrious music fan dig through mounds of music and hopefully come up with something that jives with their tastes.
neu	However, there comes a point when genre, sub-genre, and sub-sub-genre classifications become more of a distraction than a meaningful way of choosing music.
neu	To say that the New York band Bell Hollow is "post-punk" or "dream-scape 80s refresh" is needlessly hyper classifying otherwise elegantly simple and enjoyable music.
neu	FOXGLOVES, aside from pontification and sub-genre classification, is a listenable album.
neu	Sadly, while I enjoy most of the music, I cannot engage with the vocals.
neu	Lead singer Nike Nile's voice just doesn't do it for me.
neu	I know that is highly subjective, and you may love his voice, but I don't and that makes this album tougher for me to enjoy.
neu	I still give it 3 stars because the music itself is good if not great.
neu	There is little here that is edgy or super original, nothing that grabs the listener and forces them to pay attention.
neu	Successful at being average, this is an album that I won't find myself listening to often.

neu	The basketball mechanics are solid, almost perfect.
neu	You really feel like you have total control over the player, and each superstar plays distinctively different.
neu	The DNA option, which updates rosters and player ratings/tendencies to reflect real life NBA performance, is superb, and it really feels like you're playing in the NBA. If you want a great online sports game, grab this, just don't expect EA to get everything right.

neu	This is a really cool story.
neu	I loved the strong, independent main character.
neu	I also thought the fallen angel story was really neat, and I wanted more of it.
neu	The cover was also very interesting.
neu	I'd love to read a book written by the author in the format of the preface.
neu	I was really enjoying that style of writing.
neu	It reminded me of Poe in a Young Adult format.
neu	I liked the strong vocabulary in this book, as well.
neu	Things I wasn't a fan of--the ending was to cutesy for my taste.
neu	Also, all of the side characters (particularly the mom, Vee, and the teacher) were incredibly flat and stereotypical to me.
neu	I look forward to recommending this to my students who enjoy Twilight.

neu	The initial CD version of No Parlez included only longer versions of the hit singles alongside a few other songs.
neu	The album versions from the album were, however, nowhere to be found.
neu	In the liner notes of this re-release Paul Young describes those versions as being wearing; not an understatement.
neu	According to Paul, the album version was always the true version and finally one can listen to it on CD a quarter of a century later.
neu	It took me not a whole lot longer than zero seconds to realize that something was wrong.
neu	The starting crushing interplay of bass & drums on Come Back and Stay is nowhere to be heard, the songs simply "starts".
neu	When I heard that the middle section where Paul sings "Since You've Been Gone...." is truncated did I realize that this is the single version being used, NOT the original album version.
neu	Things get worse: Love Will Tear Us Apart is presented here without the intro on the original album, again it simply "starts".
neu	Similar story with Love of the Common People, the long intro on the album has been shortened, similar as to the single version although I am not sure whether its identical, it is a bit longer than the version on his Time compilation.
neu	I think/hope I have spotted all the faults.
neu	The production at the time was revolutionary; Lauri Latham (later worked with Echo & the Bunnymen, Squeeze and The Stranglers) came with a distinctive glossy and crisp sound.
neu	Although it became soon dated, it sounds today very fresh.
neu	The re-mastering is good, it is as if the tapes were cleaned with the separation much clearer.
neu	The music has also aged well, Paul Young's voice still gives me goose bumps.
neu	A bonus CD is included with the boring 12 inch versions but an interesting version of Tears For Fears' Pale Shelter and 2 great live recordings.
neu	In whole, a major disappointment due to shortened versions, and simply baffling since it is stated that this IS the original album.
neu	I thus give it only three stars, which may be generous.
neu	Any comments, especially from someone responsible for this re-release would be welcomed.

neu	Pros: Simple and functional base gameplay.Amazingly good controls (the touch screen shines in this game)....Cons: The music is pretty annoying.The game will only last so long before getting stale.Default scores on scoreboard are too high.
neu	Zoo Keeper is basically Bejeweled.
neu	Most everyone and their mom have played Bejeweled.
neu	Which means, people have basically played Zoo Keeper. That doesn't mean the game is bad.
neu	It's actually a very good puzzle game.
neu	And man, that stylus control just makes you love the DS.Zoo Keeper's basic premise is to line up 3 or more same animals horizontally or vertically.
neu	This will make them disappear and anything above the animals in the line will fall to fill the space.
neu	There is a timer on the left side that you must keep from running out by capturing more animals.
neu	Simple, but addicting.
neu	The game has a very easy learning curve.
neu	And it's a good game to play on a lazy day.The biggest reason I love this game is the fact that the stylus control just works so well.
neu	It makes it seem like Bejeweled (Zoo Keeper) was initially designed for the DS. Click on the animal and drag and it will rotate in the direction you drag.
neu	It's very quick and very precise.There are 4 modes to keep you entertained.
neu	They're all basically the same.
neu	Quest is extremely hard to place in as the game has you do specific tasks like capturing 20 lions without capturing too many other animals.
neu	Time Attack is great for short 6 minute play sessions.
neu	The other two are marathon game types.The game also has single cart multiplayer aka DS Download Play. It's a fun experience though sometimes luck has a big hand in who wins.
neu	Luck because sometimes animals will just conveniently continue to line up as more animals fall from the top.
neu	The multiplayer, like the rest of the game, is very simple but functional enough.The game is probably not worth it's original price tag of $30. It's currently selling for $20. But you can find it for cheaper if you look around.
neu	It's definitely worth the $10 I got it for.

neu	Pros: this is a very attractive sportband.
neu	It has slot of neat features such as the snap clip for the armband that will male it easy to loosen and tighten the armband on demand.
neu	It also has the cable wrap for your headphone so it won't get into the way while exercising.
neu	Cons: the iPhone 3GS simply won't fit into the pouch.
neu	It is way too tight and appears to have not been designed correctly.
neu	For instance, there is a small whole where the earpiece of the phone is suppose to line up.
neu	But regardless of how hard I pushed the iPhone down it won't go any further leaving the top of the phone exposed and earpiece unalligned.
neu	Also, around hole where the iPhone goes in, there's a thin strip of what appears to be paper that's glued around the mouth is located.
neu	The paper broke the moment you stretch the hole slightly to insert the iPhone.
neu	Very poor quality and design.
neu	No wonder it is getting cheaper by the day.
neu	Highly not recommend it.

neu	I bought these headphones because the reviews were really good.
neu	They were alot smaller than it seemed in the pictures.
neu	They seemed really flimsy, even though they were the 25th anniversary edition which was a contributing factor for me returning them.
neu	My brother tried them and really liked them, when i tried them they were pretty good, but they were not excellent as i thought they would be.
neu	Maybe ididn't let them kick in enough time or something but i returned them 2 days later.
neu	(Ps) The box and carrying bag they came with were pretty cool though, the coin looked pretty cheap tho.)

neu	This game is pretty easy to play but when u play for a few hours....
neu	u will find that the talking time gets longer and longer...
neu	and whats make me stop playing is that after i finish a tournment and cont my mission.
neu	I accidentally die and GAME OVER... Then i release that my previous save point is far far beyong...
neu	I have been playing for abt 4 hrs and all th SAVE POINT i get to use is ONLY 4.... Cos without the save pt, u cant save at all...
neu	even after u finish killing a Boss or tournment, u cant even save...
neu	The distance between save pts is a few town away...
neu	wat the hell !!! So it was a waste of time...
neu	If they want to make save with onl at SAVE POINT, then they should at least have one on every town...
neu	U cant imagine us playing for few hours and don't die at all...
neu	and if die is game over...
neu	Should have some checkpoint at least so that if we kill by boss then we cant rematch again...
neu	Thinking that if u go fight the boss without any saving...
neu	Is not that the boss is a sure win situation rite...
neu	there is a very high chance that we'll be kill by the boss...

neu	It pains me to give a King's X album such a low score.
neu	I mean, I own the entire catalog, I've seen the band live at least ten times, and have even had beers with the guys after a show.
neu	I remember hearing them for the first time as a kid watching late-night TV when their video for Over My Head made a splash for a while on MTV. I've been a fan ever since.
neu	But, alas, I have to be truthful and honest about this collection, as nothing less will benefit the band or fans.
neu	This is a sub-par album for any band, let alone one as stellar as King's X. As many have already mentioned, it's a modern recording of a bunch of rehashed throw-away tunes that didn't make it onto their first album, Out of the Silent Planet. They were put in the circular file then, and that's honestly where they should have stayed.
neu	The sound is dated, the structures are boring, the lyrics are juvenile and banal...need I go on?
neu	It's cheesy, 1980s pop-rock that is barely saved by the fact that it being played by a band with incredible execution.
neu	Screamer is novel enough, but that's the problem: it's merely a novelty song to show off Doug's screaming ability.
neu	Rock Pile has a decent enough verse, but the chorus is sickeningly goofy.
neu	Johnny is the epic tune that doesn't justify its epic length...Ty's long solo is the most pointless, meandering bunch of swoops and ambient sounds he's ever put together into a single chain.
neu	The title track is passable.
neu	Honestly, this album should be avoided by anyone except collectors.
neu	It is definitely not the place to start if you're just trying to get into King's X. If you really want to support this band, buy their latest CD, Ogre Tones, which is an excellent, excellent album.
neu	It has a great variety of sound, and should satisfy both their later fans that are used to the "heavy" version of King's X as well as their earlier fans that long to hear the soaring guitar and Beatlesesque harmonies.
neu	I'm a fan of both eras, truly, and I think it's their best CD since Please Come Home Mr. Bulbous, and possibly since Dogman (another awesome disc that everyone should own).
neu	Avoid this one, but don't avoid King's X. I'm one of those music nerds who owns like 1500 CDs, and if I had to give up all but, say, 100 of them, I would take up slots in that batch for all of my King's X CDs. This is one of the best overall rock bands still recording that hasn't ever sold out and keeps pumping out great tunes.
neu	They deserve many a listen...just don't start with Black Like Sunday.

neu	Readers of Dean Koontz's Frankenstein have been anticipating the final volume in the series for years.
neu	It wasn't worth the wait.
neu	Released late last month, Dead and Alive wraps up the author's modernization of the Frankenstein story four years later than originally planned.
neu	Reasons for the delay include Koontz's dislike of working with co-authors (both of whose names have been dropped from new printings of books one and two) to the effect of the real-life Hurricane Katrina on the story's New Orleans setting.
neu	Somewhere between 2005 and now, Koontz decided not to take the whole thing too seriously: What began as a pulpish horror/adventure story with humorous overtones has morphed into a full-blown farce, complete with a naked, dancing troll with a taste for bath soap and interminable scenes filled with wacky patter that would be more at home in a romantic comedy.
neu	Only Deucalion, Victor's first creation from the Mary Shelly novel that served as inspiration for this updating, is still played straight.
neu	Detectives Carson O'Connor and Michael Madison are reduced to supporting roles, nattering on about raising babies (they're now in love), eating and shooting guns.
neu	A Three Stooges moment as they pursue a naked husband and wife -- one of whom has a "perky butt" -- who are in turn pursuing a dog gives them their sole opportunity to use the guns they have been ogling since book two.
neu	The long build-up given to their anticipated shoot out with Victor Frankenstein is a dead end.
neu	They would have been just as appropriately armed with rubber-band guns and paper clips.
neu	Koontz finds his footing in the final chapters, a Lovecraftian showdown between Frankenstein and his artificial creations inside a series of tunnels beneath a dump.
neu	He even sets up a possible sequel and makes a connection to his popular Odd Thomas series.
neu	But it's too little, too late.
neu	After 352 relentlessly padded pages (I gave up counting how many times Koontz tells us that Victor's creatures gain their memories through data-downloads), the Frankenstein series that began with so much promise limps across the finish line, a pale shadow of what it could have been.

neu	I've owned every Crash Bandicoot game ever, and am a big fan.
neu	This game is almost exactly like the old Crash Bandicoot platformers, apart from a few noticable differences.
neu	The graphics are better and run very smoothly, without a single hitch or framerate problem.
neu	The only thing is though, is that if you've played Xbox games with great graphics, Halo, for instance, then you will be disgusted by this games' graphics.
neu	Another thing-Crash does not play as well as he used to.
neu	Crash used to run- now he seems to run, but very slowly.
neu	He runs as if he has been running for 400 miles beforehand.
neu	Also, his movements and actions are very slow and he appears to glide when he jumps.
neu	Also, if you are used to the difficulty level of every other Crash Bandicoot game ever made (which is stupidly easy) then you will be surprised by the Wrath of Cortex. It is very difficult, and offers a great challenge, especially the boss levels.
neu	Other than these, The wrath of cortex is a very enjoyable platformer, with some great action moments and puzzles to figure out.
neu	The only problem is, if you enjoyed the previous Crash Bandicoot games, you may be disappointed by his laest outing.
neu	I reccommend this only if you want a challenge or if you've never played a Crash Bandicoot game before.

neu	Mr. Lieven does an excellent job in his analysis of the Chechen conflict, but readers should use caution against potential bias.
neu	During his time in Chechnya, the author seems to have grown quite affectionate toward the Chechens.
neu	This leads to the Russians being painted as the villain (not that they are angels, but neither are the Chechens).
neu	However, Mr. Lieven does provide a fascinating insight into the war.
neu	I love his miniature analyses of the evolution of modern war.
neu	This book is not for beginners, but few Yale publishings are.
neu	Beginnners should look for a Chechnya book from a mass-market publisher.

neu	"Don't believe the hype" I wanted to love this game so bad.
neu	It seems lately all games are missing that old feeling I used to get that caused me to play a game for days and months.
neu	Unfortunately, Assassins Creed failed with me also.
neu	The game play is annoying, repetitive, and stupidly hard.
neu	I have a lot of problems with this game.
neu	First of all, you do the exact same things through the whole game.
neu	Save citizens, pick pocket, climb buildings to get to view points, interrogate, rinse, repeat.
neu	The game never changes up, it is the same all the way through.
neu	One of the most repetitive games I have ever played.
neu	The combat, oh boy the combat.
neu	There are a lot of cool moves and fighting abilities you can use, but you will never need too.
neu	I will now tell you all you need to know to survive any fight you get into, hold RT, hit X as soon as your foe attacks, and you counter, that's all you need to do.
neu	If they grab, you, hit B instead of X to break the hold.
neu	You have now mastered the fighting game.
neu	Now you ask, why did you say this game is so hard if the fighting is easy?
neu	Let me explain the most annoying part, even more annoying than the repetitiveness.
neu	Many missions require you to assassinate and go unnoticed, understandable for this game, and they are cool, except it is all but impossible to go unnoticed.
neu	You can be minding your own business, and boom the guards spot you and you are fighting again.
neu	Then guess what, time to replay the whole segment, but you have to listen and watch the same video and mission start again because there is no skip option.
neu	Brilliant, loving this.
neu	Let's throw in the fact you have time limits on these assassination missions also, and you get a completely annoying game that is cheap and will aggravate you past the point of reason.
neu	Why oh why did that 1 guard see me with 20 seconds left as I slowly walk back to my informant?
neu	Well, time to try again.
neu	This is not fun.
neu	You are too stealth as an assassin right?
neu	And I agree the game should not be easy, but it is almost impossible, which really ruins a game based on stealth.
neu	Very disappointing for a game I looked forward too so much.

neu	I played this on my friend's 360 and then on my own Playstation 3. (I confess that I'm a Playstation fan -- bought the PS1, PS2, and now the PS3.) The frame rate and color depth on the PS3 version are pretty depressing in comparison to the 360 version.
neu	Sure, it's a simple little game; jump around and hack and slash or use your specials.
neu	It's a mindless sort of fun.
neu	Simple. But you'd think they could do more with a $600 system and such a "simple" game.
neu	It's not like it's using photo-realistic graphics or anything, and yet...
neu	I feel like I'm using a really slow computer to play a really graphically enhanced game.
neu	Needless to say, I feel very let down.
neu	The game itself is good, the game on this system is not.
neu	At least I still have Fight Night...

Great idea, can you do this . . . etc. We have discussed when our children are out of school, perhaps there is spot in the business for my husband--gotta keep the regular pay check.

neu	My 3 year old son absolutely loved playing this game.....

neu	I tried to get him to play through it once more but he kept screaming.
neu	"I already played this story.
neu	I want more Diego!"
neu	My advice is to not buy this game for your children.
neu	Especially not any over 3 years old.
neu	It was a total waste of my money.
neu	If I could return it and get a refund I would.
neu	And I would get a game that's not so easy that a 3 year old can beat it in 3 days.

neu	This set of 6 CDs takes the book of the Cosmic Jesus one step further.
neu	The book explores the Words of Jesus in their original Aramaic.
neu	The CD book takes those concepts and Douglas-Klotz' scholarship into the realm of the auditory.
neu	The author/speaker carefully explains the meanings of the sayings of Jesus in their original Aramaic then teaches the listener the language forms of the various words.
neu	He then takes it to the next step of providing chants for use in meditation.
neu	These chants are accompanied by modern but appropriate guitar music and enable the listener/participator to enter more sensually into the original language.
neu	This is an extremely useful set of CDs for anyone who wishes to develop their spiritual meditative life.
neu	Interestingly I would have expected that it would be suitable only for a Christian participator.
neu	However the understanding of the Aramaic words gives such a clear liberal theological and spiritual basis of the unity of the Creator that it is accessible to anyone of any religious or spiritual tradition.
neu	Having used the CDs and having read the original book, I am also left wondering how "The Passion of Christ" a la Mel Gibson could use the Aramaic in order to present such a traditional conservative and violent view of the life and death of Jesus without leading the viewers into a more universal expression of compassion that is so evident in the CDs. Fully recommended

neu	Let me preface this review by saying that I don't hate Paul Oakenfold.
neu	I don't have a personal vendetta to pursue against him, and in fact I absolutely love Bunkka and Tranceport.
neu	That said, this album is very poor.
neu	Oakenfold is one of the main reasons I began to love trance, electronica, and even dance.
neu	When I first heard Tranceport, I was amazed with what I was hearing, and began to dig into a whole new world of music I had never known about before.
neu	I owe Mr. Oakenfold a debt for turning me on to music I now love and listen to on a daily basis.
neu	Unfortunately, Oakenfold has stumbled quite a bit in this collection.
neu	This is not a trance album.
neu	It is a collection of pop-happy fluff, filler, and unremarkable songs that simply don't appeal to me at all.
neu	I realize that opinions vary, and I'm sure I'll get lit up for writing a negative review, but I really felt obligated to let people know to save their money.
neu	Most of the songs in this collection sound like club anthems that would be more at home on a Ministry of Sound collection of euro pop. Paul used to know how to mix soaring vocals with a killer beat so that both complimented one another perfectly (Southern Sun from Bunkka is a great example of this).
neu	Now it seems that many of the vocals are too heavy for the music, and the beat gets lost in the background.
neu	Even the remix of Southern Sun found in this collection is inferior to the original.
neu	Also, many of these tracks are just filler or fluff, such as the James Bond Theme remix which is listed on the Amazon track list as: "9. James Bone Theme - Paul Oakenfold, Norman, Monty" James Bone Theme is about right.
neu	I honestly can't think of a time when I want to listen to trance and I think to myself "You know what would be great?
neu	Listening to some movie soundtrack remixes!"
neu	If this is a collection of Oakenfold's 'greatest' hits, then were are tracks like 'Gamemaster,' from Tranceport or 'Ready Steady Go,' from Bunkka?
neu	Where is 'Zoo York,' and 'Get em up' also from Bunkka?
neu	This is not a collection of his greatest work.
neu	It is a collection of meaningless, passionless remixes or pop dance tunes.
neu	If you loved Tranceport, don't spend your money on this CD. If you loved Bunkka, don't spend your money either.
neu	If you love movie sound tracks, pop remixes, or soft edged dance music, you might enjoy this CD.

neu	HOSTEL (2006) ** Jay Hernandez, Derek Richardson, Eythor Gudjonsson, Barbara Nedeljakova, Jana Kaderabkova, Jan Vlasak, Jennifer Lim, Lubomir Silhavecky, Paula Wild, Lubomir Bukovy, Rick Hoffman.
neu	Eurotrash'd.
neu	Filmmaker Eli Roth is making a noble attempt to rescue the horror genre that he so adores and in his sophomore go he succeeds just-a-bit more than his debut with the overwrought and undercooked "Cabin Fever", its Cravian flesh-eating virus in the boonies misfire.
neu	In "Hostel" a trio of horny college students traveling abroad in Europe are looking for cheap thrills in Amsterdam's state of debauchery by imbibing with as much hash and whores as possible until they get derailed in a stop-over in Slovakia where they are informed the women there are undeniably hot and bothered and the illicit means of getting trashed are theirs for the taking.
neu	The three buddies - two Americans, Pax and Josh (Hernandez and Richardson, respectively) and an Icelandic self-proclaimed 'king of swing' Oli (Gudjonsson) - find the hostel and more than they bargained for: two hotties (Nedeljakova and Kaderabkova) sharing their room (and bodily fluids before the night is over).
neu	The next morning Oli is nowhere to be found and after several cell phone calls get a few messages of their bud high-tailing it with no explanation.
neu	Along the way they encountered an odd Danish businessman (Vlasak) whose clumsy pass at Josh infuriated the young man to no end but the two meet again unlikely at the local watering hole and deciding to make international peace Josh buys the Dane a drink and some words of advice.
neu	The next thing he knows it, Josh is bound in his underwear to a hard chair in a dank dungeon and his drinking buddy with a tray of sharp surgical equipment glittering sinisterly nearby.
neu	What follows is a nauseating display of carnage and torture but frankly not as gore-iffic as I anticipated with the hyperbole that the film was offered in its ads and the fact that none-other-than Quentin Tarantino as an executive producer glad-handling the media declaring this to be the scariest, sickest violent infused fest in a decade or so.
neu	I'm no prude but I think Roth skimped out on the Gran Guignol this could've been and without sounding sadomasochistic I like my gore to be buckets of, not a sponge job.
neu	The scares that fail to come are largely due to Roth's build up (finally) after nearly a half hour of lead up with unlikable characters whose sympathy we're supposed to gather by the time they meet their fates with grisly results when in fact the punches are indeed pulled.
neu	I admit the last fifteen minutes make up for the lack of ghoulish could've beens with gusto and self-righteous "yeah" paybacks but the trip itself is unsavory.
neu	While the sex scenes are plentiful (thanks Eli!)
neu	and the subversive comic relief in the grotty hamlet's gang of pre- pubescent street gang as some ersatz "Village of the Damned" is highly welcomed (finally also that the 'hot' babes are indeed well-endowed and hot) the film feels compromised of what if promises to deliver: shock.
neu	In fact if feels like a glimpse of The Gimp sequence from Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" (several scenes feel cribbed from this and could best describe the film as a whole).
neu	Nothing is shocking really when you already know that the results will be nasty "Saw" - like environs, Eurotrash baddies and a few well-shot sequences of tension (the one true gross-out ocular venture's money shot is indeed not for the squeamish), however Roth has a lot more to make up for in his shortcomings, namely one character we can totally relate to and support in his hellish nightmare.
neu	Otherwise it is a somewhat gallant attempt to do what Sam Raimi, John Carpenter and others have pioneered in the late Seventies and early Eighties: horror with heart.

neu	I'm still on the first level but so far I can yell: THERE IS NO ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CAMERA!

neu	Not only you have the old lock behind the Ryo button but now you have total control over camera movement with the right stick (and you can adjust the speed of it at any time).

neu	I, like the first reviewer, first heard Robert Berry on the Yes tribute album and I thought he put a neat spin on on the Yes classic Roundabout.
neu	I really never thought much more about Robert Berry. That was until Greg Stone who does a progressive rock radio show in the bay area, started to play some songs from this album Prime Cuts. Wow, Robert Berry, who is from the bay area has paid homage to some of the best prog acts of the 70's.
neu	It's neat to hear some of these songs with a screaming guitar in them and a different musical twist.
neu	How cool is it to hear ELP with a raging electric guitar and the song not being overpwoered by keyboards?
neu	Very cool, not that ELP's version isn't great too.
neu	He also has some differentt takes on the Genesis classic Watcher of the Skies and he covers Amborsia which he was once a member.
neu	He also does some interesting covers of rush, Pink Floyd and Jethro tull.
neu	I would never say that this is essential prog material, but hey, for a few bucks you could buy this or buy some of todays musical drivel, I'll go for this Thanks.

neu	While I was reading this book, I went back and forth from between being inspired to being annoyed.
neu	The message is good, but the condescending tone just gets to be too much.
neu	I wish everyone could read what they say about the feedlot fattening operations - I think many would be inspired to seek out free range meat.
neu	Likewise with the heirloom vegetables.
neu	The superior attitude and preachy tone works against their message, though.
neu	Why be so snarky towards such easy targets as the vegan starlet?
neu	Also, it seems more than a little condescending to say that certain Hindus weren't really vegetarian because of the insect parts contaminating their flour.
neu	I don't understand why they seem so determined to diminish the value of vegetarianism - it would have been better to emphasize that this is another good way to reduce the negative impact on the earth.
neu	Trying to persuade people to change their habits is difficult, and it requires a sense of humor, and respect for the people you are trying to reach.
neu	It's too bad, but I think most of the people that are going to be persuaded by this book were probably almost there already.

neu	I suppose this game is just the icing on the cake after Squares last two Final Fantasy games.
neu	Final Fantasy VII had no plot, and Final Fantasy VIII played like a Jane Austin Novel. Final Fantasy IX regurgitates every possible cliche in history, and draws out these cliches for hours.
neu	Overall, the effort put into this games plot must have been minimal, making the game highly unmemorable.
neu	Graphics -- 8 If Square was trying to go for the ''old school'' cartoon look, so why only make the characters cartoons.
neu	The towns, castles, and dungeons look just as real as the ones from FF 7 and FF 8. This makes the characters look out of place--especially in FMV sequences--because the characters are deformed looking.
neu	The graphics are pretty, but uninspiring.
neu	Music -- 6 The music isn't bad, but it isn't good.
neu	The battle music is better the the previous two Final Fantasies, but other than that, it's all pretty unmemorable.
neu	Character themes are mellow and boring.
neu	Story -- 4 This is easily the weakest element in the game.
neu	It is about a boy named Vivi who doesn't know anything about his past and spends the whole game discovering the exact same things that Terra and Cloud discovered in Final Fantasy 6 and 7. Oh, and Garnet also discovers her past through a series of flashbacks that establish her as something that we the player already knew from the first few hours of playing the game.
neu	Zidane is a girl crazy teen who's idealistic immaturity is as boring as his one line pickups.
neu	He has no depth.
neu	At least pretty boys Locke and Squall had depth and plot backing them.
neu	Zidane seems thrown into the game as a marketing tool to entertain the 13 year old boys who will be purchasing this game.
neu	Other side characters are completely recycled and poorly developed compared to there older counterparts.
neu	Eiko is a Relm (FF6) character who takes up too much plot fawning over the sexy Zidane (oooh, monkey tails...), and Amarant is like a dummied down Shadow (FF6).
neu	Quin is of course the Gogo character, only stupider.
neu	The main characters fail to hold the players interest as well.
neu	Princess Garnet (aka Dagger), in Square tradition, is the magic using chick that was born from some special summoner race, yatta yatta.
neu	You've seen her many many times before, only the last few times you saw her, she was interesting.
neu	Rydia from FF4 held our interest because we got to see her develop from childhood to adulthood in an epic.
neu	Terra's character pulled at our heart strings as we saw the oppression of her people, and the effects of being a slave to the scientific horrors of the empire.
neu	Even Aeris from FF7 touched us when she was killed by Sephiroth.
neu	Dagger just simply exists in this title, and is so predictable, that her story could have been summed up in about 20 minutes of the game.
neu	Square gave us the ever annoying ''Active Time Event'' (ATE) in this game to give us, the player, and opportunity to see the character interact outside of the party.
neu	Weee. The ATE adds so little to the plot, and takes up so much time, that it seems that Square added them to take up time and disc space.
neu	I know what Square was attempting.
neu	They were trying to develop the characters through a series of normal events.
neu	Unfortunately, the ATEs add so little to the game that they almost interrupt the game when they occur so frequently.
neu	Now for the actual plot of the game.
neu	Disc one is spent going between the different characters, introducing them, and creating highly staged situations in which the different characters end up coming together.
neu	Zidane is the main character, however we don't really spend much time getting to know him.
neu	This may be due to the fact that his character consists of ''Don't be mad, we are all friends,'' or ''Hey baby, you look lovely today.''
neu	There really isn't anything to the main character, which is unfortunate since we spend so much time with him.
neu	Since he is a thief, why not make him more devious.
neu	There are points in the game where he admits to abuse he suffered in childhood, and that is why he became a thief.
neu	Why not expand more on that story to give his character more of an edge: making him distrustful, perhaps bitter, or even insecure.
neu	None of these factor into his character however, and we are left with a thief so lifeless and boring that we wonder what all these love sick girls see in him.
neu	The Villian is a total rehash of FF6 and FF7. His character is pointless and arbitrary to the game as a whole.
neu	He is thrown in to give us a villian.
neu	There is no real motive behind his evil, and he starts out as a powerful almost indestructible god.
neu	This is unfortunate since it alerts the player of who the last boss shall be.
neu	Why not just alert the player by saying ''Hi, I'm going to be the last boss in this game, or at least one of the last bosses.''
neu	Square's ''old school'' attempts went to waste since there really wasn't anything ''old school'' about this game--not plot wise anyway.
neu	Final Fantasy 4 and 6 were noted for their originality and ability to draw players into the game for hours at a time.
neu	As I played this game, I just wanted to hurry up and beat it.
neu	Gameplay -- 7 Well, Square fixed some things...
neu	a few. At least the characters are somewhat different from one another.
neu	Only some characters can use white magic, some black, some summon, and the rest have their own special attacks.
neu	I like this system much better than junctioning and materia and even espers.
neu	The only downside is that Square kept the system where characters learn abilities through their equipt weapons.
neu	You still get AP points and learn powerful abilities through weapons, which makes the gameplay a little easy.
neu	By the middle of the game, all of the characters have so many abilities that they are practically immune to every statis effect.
neu	Magic is learned very very slowly in this game.
neu	Instead of limit breakers, characters have trance which gives them a powerful ability that they can use.
neu	Also, you can use four characters in this game again, although it is still a step down from the five characters you could use in Final Fantasy 4. Weapons are primarily bought in stores, or forged together to make new weapons.
neu	Dungeons in this game are EXTREMELY short and only take long because of the random encounter every step and a half.
neu	And speaking of battles, this game is one of the easiest Final Fantasies ever.
neu	I never died playing this game.
neu	Bosses are simple, regular battles are simple, yet annoying since they take so long to load.
neu	Level gaining is quick, and irrelevant since it seems to not matter what level the party is at.
neu	As long as you save all your most powerful spells for the bosses, the game is a breeze.
neu	What is with Square and having the characters do 9999 damage regularly?
neu	This makes the game way too easy.
neu	The battle system is a step in the right direction after the last two FFs, but it is still rather uninspiring.
neu	Perhaps Square should attempt to create a new type of battle system that offers more intriguing strategies.
neu	At least the draw system (although it was weird and a little dumb) was an original idea.
neu	Replay -- 2 Long, Boring, and pointless.
neu	When the game is over, you feel numb, as if you have watched 3 Disney movies in a row.
neu	The game could essentially pass as a Disney movie.
neu	This Final Fantasy was extremely dissappointing, especially since I had such high hopes for it.
neu	The whole ''the crystals are back thing'' sounded nice...except that you don't bother with crystals until disc 3! The characters were beyond cliche, beyond trite, they were flat, like cardboard cut outs, or movie extras.
neu	The story was poorly developed and executed.
neu	At least Final Fantasy VIII gave us characters that we could focus on.
neu	At least Squall had an angle to him.
neu	Hell, even Cloud, the soldier who barely talked and had no recollection of the past seemed more real than any of the characters in FF9. I guess the only thing ''old school'' about this game was the lack of plot.
neu	Why not just redo Final Fantasy 1? None of the characters talked at all in the original Final Fantasy.
neu	Without all of the pointless chitter chatter, we would be allowed to beat the game quicker.
neu	All in all, I hope Square tries a little harder next time.
neu	This game could have been prevented.
neu	I wish I hadn't bought this game, and so will you.

neu	Pros: Good features, stylish looks ... Cons: This phone is very unreliable.
neu	It is not the carrier's service, it is the phone.
neu	My T720 has broke down several times.
neu	It will just turn itself off and will not turn back on.
neu	I don't know from day to day if it will work or not.
neu	I'll never buy another moto

electronics_pos_14
neu	Pros: No problems, easy to set up.
neu	Looks good.
neu	Cons: Nothing negative about it.
neu	I wanted the Samsung but purchased the Insignia on sale for $129.99 thinking I was saving money.
neu	The Insignia popped like a fire cracker.
neu	Replaced it with the Samsung Black/Red to match my TV. It was on sale for 249.00. You get what you pay for.
neu	Works wonderfully.
neu	No problems what so ever.

music_pos_101
neu	This record blows my mind.
neu	It is at once catchy, hummable and avant-garde.
neu	There are two big "wow" points here.
neu	The first is the "string," (le fil), a tone that persists throughout the entire record (and beyond, into secret-track land).
neu	This literally ties the entire record together and makes you listen to it as a suite: not that the songs don't stand by themselves, but this persistent note just keeps pulling you into the next one.
neu	The second big thing is that it is arranged almost all a cappella.
neu	Yes, there are instruments.
neu	But no, the instruments don't take center stage.
neu	It's all about the voice, the human beatbox, and the clap.
neu	This gives the record a real organic feeling: it doesn't sound as if it was spit out of a hit factory.
neu	I am amazed at Camille's self-assurance in making a record like this that relies so wholly on her own voice to carry it.
neu	The lyrics are wry, funny, and thought-provoking, but in my mind are almost completely occluded by the breathtaking arrangements and production.
neu	I am sure many people will browse this CD on Amazon and imagine that it's some kind of folk-song/chanson update, along the lines of Keren Ann, Carla Bruni, or Coralie Clement.
neu	It's not; it's more wonderful and inspiring and adventurous than those ladies' music.
neu	Incomparable is really the best word to describe "Le Fil."

neu	By A Customer I checked this out at the library and thought it had good information about how to cut your expenses and the author convinced me to pay off my mortgage early rather than putting my extra money into the stock market.
neu	The first few CD's are very entertaining.
neu	The last two CD's don't contain any useful information and are somewhat out of scope.
neu	For instance, in the last CD he spends a significant amount of time talking about why only one parent should work because it's better on the kids.
neu	He also goes on and on about how to be an asset to your company so you will get raises and not get laid off.
neu	This is the type of CD that you will only listen to once so I highly recommend checking it out at your local library and saving the cash.
neu	After all, you do want to cut down on debt, right?
