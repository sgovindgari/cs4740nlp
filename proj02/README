Naive Bayes:
To create a naive bayes model, one must first construct a training set.
To do this run constructSet() from utilities.py. constructSet takes in
a source, windowSize (-1 for all words) and then booleans to determine whether
to include certain features. usePos is True if POS features of the target word
are included. useCooccurrence is true to include cooccurrence features and
useColocation is true to include colocational features.

The list returned by constructSet can then be passed into the naive_bayes
constructor in naive_bayes.py. One can also pass in the maximum number
of examples to consider in the parameter maxExamples.

To classify a data set (generated using constructSet) one simply calls
the classify method of the naive_bayes model. classify takes 5 parameters.
The test set (list), the alpha to use in add-alpha smoothing, softscore
to determine whether softscoring should be used, kaggle to determine if it
should write a results file for kaggle and biasTowardsCommon--whether to'
include P(s|w) in the probability calculations.
