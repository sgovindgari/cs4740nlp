Introduction
- Find the correct meaning of a word in context
- Implement WSD system: one supervised method + dictionary based
- Analyze their pros and cons by evaluating on validation set 

Dataset
http://www.cse.unt.edu/~rada/senseval/senseval3/proceedings/pdf/mihalcea2.pdf

word.pos | sense-id | prev-context %% target %% next-context

Supervised WSD
- Naive Bayes model 
- Takes a word in context as input and outputs a probability distribution

Dictionary based WSD
- Utilize the definitions given in dictionary 

  implementation:
    1. preprocess the xml
       # utilities.fixDoubles(dictionarySource, dictionaryProcessed)
    2. make the dictionary from dictionaryProcessed
       - dictionary is constructed by the method parseIntoDictionary
       - Dictionary structure: 
         dictionary of word to tuple
         dict :  word -> ('part-of-sp', subdict)
         where subdict : senseid -> ('def', ['exampleslist'], [wordnet ints])
    NOTE: using function utilities.cleanString
          which would treat "they'll" as "theyll"
          throughout the ENTIRE dictionary system. This is ok because it's consistent.

Extensions
- keep track of other most likely senses and pick them when certain conditions are satisfied 
- Scoring approach that assumes the prediction of a single sense. Vote partially for each sense wrt confidence
- Show the learning curve for Naive Bayes approach 

Proposal [Division - Two for Dictionary and two for supervised]
- Describe your implementation plans for each of the two WSD systems
- What kinds of features are you planning to extract from the surrounding context for supervised WSD
- What are you going to do for finding relevant words in the context for dictionary based WSD
- Provide brief implementation schedule 
- Explanation of planned systems and algorithms [dont repeat basic models already described]
- Try to explain the motivation of your design decisions 
- Look at the training data 

Report 
- 6 pages 
- Approach, Software, Results, Discussion

Grading
- Proposal: [10 pts]
- Implementation: supervised [20 pts] / dictionary-based [20 pts]
- Report: [45 pts]
- Optional Extensions: [15 pts]

Submission 
- Proposal (pdf into CMS, hardcopy at class)
- Source code (only the code that YOUR TEAM wrote, not for any of
the common packages that your team used).
- Prediction output (the csv files you submit to Kaggle)
- The report (pdf into CMS, hardcopy at class)
- Archive all of these except the proposal, and upload it to CMS.

Overlap: occurrence of exact/similar words in the definitions of context words and target word.
